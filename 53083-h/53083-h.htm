<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">No</span> sooner had my Inclinations prevail’d upon me to publish this Author,
but my Gratitude directed me where I should make the Dedication.
These Labours are yours by many Obligations. Your Services to me
demand them, you have express’d a particular Esteem for Pieces of
this Kind, you have assisted me with a valuable Collection of Books
in the Translation of them, and you have encourag’d the Performance
by the Interest of your Friends; so that if there be any Merit in the
Publication of it, ’tis you who are entitled to it.</p>

<p>The Knowledge of <i>Antiquity</i> was always look’d upon as a Study worthy
the Entertainment of a Gentleman, and was never in higher Estimation
among the Nobility and Gentry of <i>Great Britain</i> than it is now.
And this Regard which the present Age pays to it, proceeds from a
wise Discernment, and a proportionable Value of Things. For we never
entertain our Curiosity with more Pleasure, and to better Purposes,
than by looking into the Art, and Improvement, and Industry of antient
Times, and by observing how they excited their Heroes and great Men to
virtuous and honourable Actions by the Memorials of <i>Statuary</i> and
<i>Sculpture</i>; the silent Records of their Greatness, and the lasting
History of their Glory.</p>

<p>The great Discoveries made of late, and publish’d by a <a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">A</a>Society
of Gentlemen, united in the Search of <i>Antiquity</i>, will be lasting
Monuments of their Fame in future Times, and will be look’d upon as
Arguments of an ingenious Curiosity, in looking into the delectable
Situations of Places, in preserving the beautiful Ruines of Antient
Buildings, and in setting Chronology in a truer Light, by the Knowledge
of Coins and Medals.</p>

<p>But, Sir, what I principally intend in this Dedication, is to do
Justice to Merit, and to acquaint the World, That you never look’d upon
Licentiousness, and Infidelity, to be any Part of the Character of a
fine Gentleman, That Virtue does not sit odly upon Men of a superior
Station, and That in you we have an Example of one, who has Prudence
enough to temper the innocent Freedoms of Life with the Strictnesses
of Duty, and Conduct enough to be Merry, and not Licentious, to be
Sociable, and not Austere; a Deportment this, which sets off your
Character beyond the most elaborate Expressions of Art, and is not to
be describ’d by the most curious Statue, or the most durable Marble. I
am, Sir, with very great Regard,</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>IT is customary upon a Translation to give some Account both of the
Author, and his Writings. The Author</i> Petrus Gyllius, <i>as he stands
enroll’d among the Men of Eminency, and Figure in polite Learning, I
find to be a Native of</i> Albi, <i>in</i> France. <i>He was in great Reputation
in the sixteenth Century, and was look’d upon as a Writer of so good a
Taste, and so comprehensive a</i> Genius, <i>that there was scarce any thing
in the polite Languages, which had escap’d him. As he had a particular
Regard for Men of distinguished Learning, so was he equally honour’d,
and esteem’d by them.</i> Francis <i>the First, King of</i> France, <i>the great
Patron of Literature, and who was also a good Judge of his Abilities,
sent him into</i> Italy, <i>and</i> Greece, <i>to make a Collection of all the
choice Manuscripts which had never been printed, but in his Passage it
was his Misfortune to be taken by the</i> Corsairs. <i>Some Time after, by
the Application and Generosity of Cardinal</i> d’Armanac, <i>he was redeem’d
from Slavery. The just Sense this munificent Patron had of his Merit,
incited him, when my Author had finish’d more than fourty Years Travels
over all</i> Greece, Asia, <i>and the greatest Part of</i> Africa, <i>in the
Search of Antiquity, to receive him into his Friendship, and Family;
where, while he was digesting, and methodizing his Labours for the
Service of the Publick, he dy’d in the Year 1555, and in the</i> 65ᵗʰ
<i>Year of his Age</i>.</p>

<p><i>Although it was his Intention to have published all the Learned
Observations he had made in his Travels, yet he liv’d to give us only
a Description of the</i> Bosporus, Thrace, <i>and</i> Constantinople, <i>with an
Account of the</i> Antiquities <i>of each of those Places. In his Search of
what was curious he was indefatigable, and had a perfect Knowledge of
it in all its Parts. He had also translated into</i> Latin Theodore<i>’s
Commentaries on the</i> Minor Prophets, <i>and sixteen Books of</i> &AElig;lian<i>’s</i>
History of Animals. Petrus Belonius <i>is highly reflected upon, in that
being his Domestick, and a Companion with him in his Travels, he took
the Freedom to publish several of his Works under his own Name: And
indeed such a flagrant Dishonesty in acting the Plagiary in so gross a
manner, was justly punish’d with the most severe Censures; since it
had been Merit enough to have deserv’d the Praises of the Learned World
for Publishing such valuable Pieces, with an honourable Acknowledgment
of the Author of them</i>.</p>

<p><i>I have no Occasion to vindicate the Worth and Credit of my Author,
whose Fame will live, and flourish, while the Characters given him by</i>
Gronovius, Thuanus, Morreri, Tournefort, <i>and</i> Montfaucon <i>are of any
Weight. These Great Men have recorded him to future Times, for his deep
Insight into</i> Natural <i>Knowledge, his unweary’d Application to the
Study of</i> Antiquity, <i>and his great Accuracy and Exactness in Writing</i>.</p>

<p><i>In the following Treatise, the Reader has before him a full and lively
View of one of the most magnificent Cities in the Universe; stately,
and beautiful in its Natural Situation, improv’d with all the Art and
Advantages of fine Architecture, and furnished with the most costly
Remains of Antiquity; so that</i> New Rome, <i>in many Instances of that
Kind, may seem to excell the</i> Old.</p>

<p><i>I hope my Author will not be thought too particular and exact in
describing the several Hills and Vales, upon which</i> Constantinople
<i>stands, when it is consider’d, that he is delineating</i> the Finest
Situation in the World.</p>

<p><i>The Manner in which he treats on this Subject is very entertaining;
and his Descriptions, though with the greatest Regard to Truth, are
embellish’d with a Grace and Beauty, almost Poetical. This, I look upon
it, was occasion’d by the agreeable Variety of delightful Prospects and
Situations, which the Subject naturally led him to describe.</i></p>

<p><i>The present State of</i> Constantinople, <i>I mean as to the Meanness and
Poverty of its Buildings, is attested by all those, who have either
seen, or wrote concerning it; so that ’tis not</i> Now <i>to be compar’d
with it self, as it stood in its Antient Glory. The</i> Turks <i>have such
an Aversion to all that is curious in Learning, or magnificent in
Architecture, or valuable in Antiquity, that they have made it a Piece
of Merit, for above 200 Years, to demolish, and efface every thing
of that Kind; so that this Account of the</i> Antiquities <i>of that City
given us by</i> Gyllius, <i>is not only the</i> Best, <i>but indeed the</i> Only
<i>collective History of them</i>.</p>

<p><i>In tracing out the Buildings of Old</i> Byzantium, <i>the antient</i> Greek
<i>Historians, which he perfectly understood, were of great Service to
him; this, with his own personal Observations, as residing for some
Years at</i> Constantinople, <i>furnish’d him with Materials sufficient for
the present History</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Curious, who have always admir’d the Accuracy of this Work of</i>
Gyllius, <i>have yet been highly concern’d, that it wanted the Advantage
of Cuts, by which the Reader might have the agreeable Pleasure of
surveying with the Eye, what my Author has so exactly describ’d with
the Pen</i>.</p>

<p><i>I have therefore endeavour’d to supply this Defect, by presenting
to the View of the Reader a Collection of Figures, which do not only
refer to such Curiosities as be will find mention’d in the several
Parts of my Author, but such as have been describ’d by other later
Travellers; and by this Means I hope I have given a compleat View of
whatsoever is most remarkable in the</i> Antiquities of Constantinople.
<i>The Catalogue and Order of the Cuts is as follows</i>;</p>

<p><a href="#i_png304">I.</a> <i>The</i> Thracian Bosporus, <i>with the Situation of</i> Constantinople, <i>as
antiently divided into</i> Wards; <i>from</i> Du Fresne.</p>

<p><a href="#i_png312">V.</a> <i>The outside Prospect of that Church; from the same.</i></p>

<p><a href="#i_png314">VI.</a> <i>The inside View of it; from the same.</i></p>

<p><a href="#i_png316">VII.</a> <i>The Plan of the Church of the Apostles; from Sir</i> George Wheler.</p>

<p><a href="#i_png318">VIII.</a> <i>The antient</i> Hippodrom, <i>with the</i> Theb&aelig;an Obelisk, <i>and the
Engines by which it was erected; from</i> Spon <i>and</i> Wheler.</p>

<p><a href="#i_png320">IX.</a> <i>The Three Pillars</i>, viz. <i>the Serpentine and Porphyry Pillars,
standing in the</i> Hippodrom, <i>as described by</i> Gyllius, <i>with the Pillar
of the Emperor</i> Marcian, <i>since discover’d by</i> Spon <i>and</i> Wheler <i>in a
private Garden; from</i> B. Randolph.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Constantinople</span> is situated after such a Manner in a <i>Peninsula</i>, that
’tis scarce bounded by the Continent; for on three Sides ’tis inclosed
by the Sea. Nor is it only well fortified by its natural Situation, but
’tis also well guarded by Forts, erected in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> large Fields, extending
from the City at least a two Day’s Journey, and more than twenty Miles
in Length. The Seas that bound the <i>Peninsula</i> are <i>Pontus</i>, or the
<i>Black Sea</i>, the <i>Bosporus</i>, and the <i>Propontis</i>. The City is inclosed
by a Wall formerly built by <i>Anastasius</i>. ’Tis upon this Account that
being secured as it were by a double <i>Peninsula</i>, she entitles her self
the Fortress of all <i>Europe</i>, and claims the Preheminence over all
the Cities of the World, as hanging over the Straits both of <i>Europe</i>
and <i>Asia</i>. For besides other immense Advantages peculiar to it, this
is look’d upon as a principal Convenience of its Situation, that ’tis
encompassed by a Sea abounding with the finest Harbours for Ships;
on the South by the <i>Propontis</i>, on the East by the <i>Bosporus</i>, and
on the North by a Bay full of Ports, which can not only be secured
by a Boom, but even without such a Security, can greatly annoy the
Enemy. For the Walls of <i>Constantinople</i> and <i>Galata</i> straitning its
Latitude into less than half a Mile over, it has often destroy’d the
Enemies Ships by liquid Fire, and other Instruments of War. I would
remark farther, that were it secured according to the Improvements
of modern Fortification, it would be the strongest Fortress in the
World; <i>viz.</i> if the four ancient Ports, formerly inclosed within
its Walls by Booms, were rebuilt; two of which (being not only the
Ornament, but the Defence of old <i>Byzantium</i>) held out a Siege
against <i>Severus</i> for the Space of three Years; nor could it ever be
obliged to a Surrender, but by Famine only. For besides the Profits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>and Advantages it receives from the <i>Propontis</i> and <i>&AElig;gean</i> Sea,
it holds an absolute Dominion over the <i>Black Sea</i>; and by one Door
only, namely by the <i>Bosporus</i>, shuts up its Communication with any
other part of the World; for no Ship can pass this Sea, if the Port
thinks fit to dispute their Passage. By which means it falls out,
that all the Riches of the <i>Black Sea</i>, whether exported or imported,
are at her Command. And indeed such considerable Exportations are
made from hence of Hydes of all Kinds, of Honey, of Wax, of Slaves,
and other Commodities, as supply a great Part of <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i>
and <i>Africa</i>; and on the other hand, there are imported from those
Places such extraordinary Quantities of Wine, Oil, Corn, and other
Goods without Number, that <i>Mysia</i>, <i>Dacia</i>, <i>Pannonia</i>, <i>Sarmatia</i>,
<i>M&aelig;otis</i>, <i>Colchis</i>, <i>Spain</i>, <i>Albania</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, <i>Armenia</i>,
<i>Media</i>, <i>Parthia</i>, and both Parts of <i>Scythia</i>, share in the great
Abundance. ’Tis for this Reason, that not only all foreign Nations, if
they would entitle themselves to any Property in the immense Wealth of
the <i>Black Sea</i>, but also all Sea Port and Island Towns are obliged
to court the Friendship of this City. Besides, ’tis impossible for
any Ships to pass or repass, either from <i>Asia</i> or <i>Europe</i>, but at
her Pleasure, she being as it were the Bridge and Port of both those
Worlds; nay, I might call her the Continent that joins them, did
not the <i>Hellespont</i> divide them. But this Sea is thought, in many
Respects, to be inferior to that of <i>Constantinople</i>; first, as it is
much larger, and then, as not having a Bay as that has, by which its
City might be made a <i>Peninsula</i>, and a commodious Port for Ships:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>And indeed if it had such a Bay, yet could it reap no Advantage of
Commerce from the <i>Black Sea</i>, but by the Permission of the People of
<i>Constantinople</i>. <i>Constantine</i> at first began to build a City upon
<i>Sigeum</i>, a Promontory hanging over the Straits of the <i>Hellespont</i>;
but quitting that Situation, he afterwards pitch’d upon a Promontory
of <i>Byzantium</i>. <i>Troy</i>, I acknowledge, is a magnificent City, but they
were blind, who could not discover the Situation of <i>Byzantium</i>; all
stark blind, who founded Cities within View of it, either on the Coast
of the <i>Hellespont</i>, or the <i>Propontis</i>; which though they maintain’d
their Grandeur for some Time, yet at present are quite in Ruins, or
have only a few Streets remaining, and which, if they were all rebuilt,
must be in Subjection to <i>Constantinople</i>, as being superior in Power
to all of them. Wherefore we may justly entitle her the Key, not only
of the <i>Black Sea</i>, but also of the <i>Propontis</i> and the <i>Mediterranean
Sea</i>. <i>Cyzicus</i> (now called <i>Chazico</i>) is highly in Esteem, for that
it joins by two Bridges the Island to the Continent, and unites two
opposite Bays, and is, as <i>Aristides</i> informs us, the Bond of the
<i>Black</i>, and the <i>Mediterranean Sea</i>; but any Man, who has his Eyes
in his Head, may see, that ’tis but a very weak one. The <i>Propontis</i>
flows in a broad Sea, between <i>Cyzicus</i> and <i>Europe</i>; by which Means
as a Passage is open into both Seas, though the People of <i>Cyzicus</i>
should pretend to dispute it; so they on the other hand, should the
People of <i>Hellespont</i> or <i>Constantinople</i> contest it with them, could
have no Advantage of the Commerce of either of those Seas. I shall say
nothing at present of <i>Heraclea</i>, <i>Selymbria</i>, and <i>Chalcedon</i>, seated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>on the Coast of the <i>Propontis</i>, anciently Cities of Renown, both
for the Industry of their Inhabitants, and the Agreeableness of their
Situation; but they could never share in the principal Commodities
of other Towns of Traffick, in the Neighbourhood of the Port of
<i>Constantinople</i>, which was always look’d upon as impregnable. The
Harbours of those Cities have lain for a considerable time all under
Water, so that they were not of sufficient Force to sail the <i>Bosporus</i>
and the <i>Hellespont</i>, without the Permission of the Inhabitants of
those Places: But the <i>Byzantians</i> rode Masters of the <i>Black Sea</i>,
in Defiance of them all. <i>Byzantium</i> therefore seems alone exempted
from those Inconveniencies and Incapacities which have happen’d to her
Neighbours, and to many other potent and flourishing Cities, which for
several Years having lain in their own Ruins, are either not rebuilt
with their ancient Grandeur, or have changed their former Situation.
All its neighbouring Towns are yet lost: There is only the Name of
<i>Memphis</i> remaining. Whereas <i>Babylon</i>, seated in its Neighbourhood,
from a small Fort, is become a large and populous City; and yet neither
of them is so commodious as <i>Constantinople</i>. I shall take no Notice
of <i>Babylon</i> in <i>Assyria</i>, who, when she was in her most flourishing
State, had the Mortification to see a City built near her, equal in
Largeness to her self: Why is not <i>Alexandria</i> rebuilt, but because
she must support her self more by the Industry of her People, than the
Agreeableness of her Situation? ’Twas the Sanctity of St. <i>Peter</i>,
and the Grandeur of the <i>Roman</i> Name, that contributed more to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>rebuilding old <i>Rome</i>, than the natural Situation of the Place itself,
as having no Convenience for Ships and Harbours. I pass by in Silence
<i>Athens</i> and <i>Laced&aelig;mon</i>, which were more remarkable for the Learning
and resolute Bravery of their People, than the Situation of their
City. I omit the two Eyes of the Sea Coast, <i>Corinth</i> and <i>Carthage</i>,
both which falling into Ruins at the same Time, were first repaired by
<i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>; afterwards, when they fell entirely to decay, nobody
rebuilt them: And though <i>Carthage</i> is seated in a <i>Peninsula</i> with
several Havens about it, yet in no part of it are there two Seas which
fall into each other: For though <i>Corinth</i> may be said to lie between
two Seas, and is call’d the Fort of <i>Peloponnesus</i>, the Key and Door
of <i>Greece</i>; yet is it so far from uniting in one Chanel two Seas, or
two Bays adjoining to the <i>Peninsula</i>, that she was never able to make
Head against the <i>Macedonians</i> or <i>Romans</i>, as <i>Cyzico</i> and <i>Negropont</i>
did; the one by its well built Forts and other War-like Means, and the
other by the Strength of its natural Situation. But <i>Constantinople</i>
is the Key both of the <i>Mediterranean</i> and <i>Black Sea</i>, which alone,
by the best Skill in Navigation, nay though you were to make a Voyage
round the World, you will find to meet only in one Point, and that is,
the Mouth of the Port. I shall say nothing of <i>Venice</i>, which does
not so much enclose the Sea for proper Harbours, as ’tis enclosed by
it, and labours under greater Difficulties to keep off the Swellings
and Inundations of the Seas, than unite them together. I pass by the
Situations of the whole Universe, wherever there are, have, or shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>be Cities; in none of them shall you find a Port abounding with so
many and so great Conveniencies, both for the Maintenance of its
Dominion over the Seas, and the Support of Life, as in this City. It
is furnish’d with Plenty of all manner of Provisions, being supply’d
with Corn by a very large Field of <i>Thrace</i>, extending itself, in some
Parts of it, a Length of seven Days, and in others, of a more than
twenty Days Journey. I shall say nothing of <i>Asia</i> adjoining to it,
abounding with the greatest Fruitfulness both of Corn and Pasture, and
the best Conveniencies for their Importation from both Seas. And as to
the immense Quantity of its Wines, besides what is the Product of its
own Soil, it is furnish’d with that Commodity from all the Coasts of
the <i>Bosporus</i>, the <i>Propontis</i>, and the <i>Hellespont</i>, which are all
well stock’d with Vineyards; and without the Danger of a long Voyage,
<i>Constantinople</i> can, at her Pleasure, import the choicest Wines of
all Kinds, and whatever else may contribute to her own Gratification
and Delight. ’Tis for this Reason that <i>Theopompus</i> gives her this
Character, That ever since she became a Mart-Town, her People were
wholly taken up, either in the Market, in the Port, or at Taverns,
giving themselves up entirely to Wine. <i>Menander</i>, in his Comedy
<i>Auletris</i>, tells us, that <i>Constantinople</i> makes all her Merchants
Sots. <i>I bouze it</i>, says one of his Actors, <i>all Night; and upon my
waking after the Dose, I fancy I have no less than four Heads upon
my Shoulders</i>. The Comedians play handsomely upon them, in giving
us an Account, that when their City was besieged, their General had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>no other Way to keep his Soldiers from deferring, but by building
Taverns within the Walls; which, tho’ a Fault proceeding from their
popular Form of Government, yet at the same time denotes to us the
great Fruitfulness of their Soil, and the great Plenty they have of
Wine. They who have been Eye-witnesses can best attest, how well they
are provided with Flesh, with Venison and Fowls, which they might
share more abundantly, but that they are but indifferent Sportsmen.
Their Markets are always stored with the richest Fruits of all Kinds.
If any Objection be made to this, I would have it consider’d, what
Quantities the <i>Turks</i> use, after hard Drinking, to allay their
Thirst. And as to Timber, <i>Constantinople</i> is so plentifully supply’d
with that, both from <i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia</i>, and will in all probability
continue to be so, that she can be under no Apprehensions of a Scarcity
that way, as long as she continues a City. Woods of an unmeasurable
Length, extending themselves from the <i>Propontis</i> beyond <i>Colchis</i>,
a more than forty Days Journey, contribute to her Stores so that she
does not only supply the neighbouring Parts with Timber for building
Ships and Houses, but even <i>&AElig;gypt</i>, <i>Arabia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, partake
in the inexhaustible Abundance; while she, of all the Cities in the
World, cannot lie under the want of Wood of any Kind, under which,
even in our Time, we have observed the most flourishing Cities, both
of <i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia</i>, sometimes to have fallen. <i>Marseilles</i>,
<i>Venice</i>, <i>Taranto</i>, are all famous for Fish; yet <i>Constantinople</i>
exceeds them all in its Abundance of this Kind. The Port is supply’d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>with vast Quantities from both Seas; nor do they swim only in thick
Shoals through the <i>Bosporus</i>, but also from <i>Chalcedon</i> to this Port.
Insomuch that twenty Fish-Boats have been laden with one Net; and
indeed they are so numberless, that oftentimes from the Continent you
may take them out of the Sea with your Hands. Nay, when in the Spring,
they swim up into the <i>Black Sea</i>, you may kill them with Stones.
The Women, with Osier Baskets ty’d to a Rope, angle for them out of
the Windows, and the Fishermen with bare Hooks take a sort of Fish
of the <i>Tunny</i> Kind, in such Quantities, as are a competent Supply
to all <i>Greece</i>, and a great part of <i>Asia</i> and <i>Europe</i>. But not to
recount the different Kinds of Fish they are stock’d with, they catch
such Multitudes of Oysters, and other Shell Fish, that you may see
in the Fish Market every Day, so many Boats full of them, as are a
Sufficiency to the <i>Grecians</i>, all their Fast-Days, when they abstain
from all sorts of Fish which have Blood in them. If there was not so
considerable a Plenty of Flesh at <i>Constantinople</i>, if the People took
any Pleasure in eating Fish, and their Fishermen were as industrious as
those of <i>Venice</i> and <i>Marseilles</i>, and were also allow’d a Freedom in
their Fishery, they would have it in their Power, not only to pay as
a Tribute a third part of their Fish at least to the Grand <i>Seignor</i>,
but also to supply all the lesser Towns in her Neighbourhood. If we
consider the Temperature of the Climate of New <i>Rome</i>, it must be
allow’d by proper Judges, that it far excels that of <i>Pontus</i>. For my
own part, I have often experienced it to be a more healthy Air than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>that of Old <i>Rome</i>; and for many Years past, I have scarce observed
above a Winter or two to have been very cold, and that the Summer Heats
have been allay’d by the northern Breezes, which generally clear the
Air for the whole Season. In the Winter, ’tis a little warm’d by the
southern Winds, which have the same Effect. When the Wind is at North,
they have generally Rain, though ’tis quite otherwise in <i>Italy</i> and
<i>France</i>. As to the Plague, ’tis less raging, less mortal, and no more
rife among them, than it is, commonly speaking, in great Cities; and
which indeed would be less rife, were it not for the Multitudes of
the common People, and the foul Way of Feeding among their Slaves.
But that I may not seem to flourish too largely in the Praise of this
City, never to be defamed by the most sour <i>Cynick</i>, I must confess
that there is one great Inconvenience it labours under, which is,
that ’tis more frequently inhabited by a savage, than a genteel and
civiliz’d People; not but that she is capable of refining the Manners
of the most rude and unpolish’d; but because her Inhabitants, by their
luxurious way of living, emasculate themselves, and for that Reason
are wholly incapable of making any Resistance against those barbarous
People, by whom, to a vast Distance, they are encompass’d on all
Sides. From hence it is, that although <i>Constantinople</i> seems as it
were by Nature form’d for Government, yet her People are neither under
the Decencies of Education, nor any Strictness of Discipline. Their
Affluence makes them slothful, and their Pride renders them averse to
an open Familiarity, and a generous Conversation; so that they avoid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>all Opportunities of being thrust out of Company for their Insolence,
or falling into Dissensions amongst themselves, by which means the
Christian Inhabitants of the Place, formerly lost both their City and
Government. But let their Quarrels and Divisions run never so high,
and throw the whole City into a Flame, as they have many times done,
nay tho’ they should rase her even with the Ground, yet she would
soon rise again out of her own Ruins, by reason of the Pleasantness
of her Situation, without which the <i>Black Sea</i> could not so properly
be called the <i>Euxine</i>, as the <i>Axine</i> Sea, (the Inhabitants of whose
Coast used to kill all Strangers that fell into their Hands) by reason
of the great Numbers of barbarous People who dwell round the <i>Black
Sea</i>. It would be dangerous venturing on the Coasts of the <i>Black
Sea</i>, either by Land or Water, which are full of Pyrates and Robbers,
unless they were kept in a tolerable Order by the Government of the
Port. There would be no passing the Straits of the <i>Bosporus</i> which
is inhabited on both Shores by a barbarous People, but for the same
Reason. And though a Man was never so secure of a safe Passage, yet he
might mistake his Road at the Mouth of the <i>Bosporus</i>, being misguided
by the false Lights, which the <i>Thracians</i>, who inhabit the Coasts of
the <i>Black Sea</i>, formerly used to hang out, instead of a <i>Pharos</i>. ’Tis
therefore not only in the Power of <i>Constantinople</i>, to prevent any
Foreigners sailing the <i>Black Sea</i>; but in reality no Powers can sail
it, without some Assistance from her. Since therefore <i>Constantinople</i>
is the Fortress of all <i>Europe</i>, both against the Pyrates of <i>Pontus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>and the Savages of <i>Asia</i>, was the never so effectually demolish’d,
as to all Appearance, yet would she rise again out of her Ruins to her
former Grandeur and Magnificence. With what Fury did <i>Severus</i> pursue
this City, even to an entire Subversion? And yet when he cool’d in his
Resentments against these People, he recollected with himself, that
he had destroy’d a City which had been the common Benefactress of the
Universe, and the grand Bulwark of the Eastern Empire. In a little time
after he began to rebuild her, and order’d her, in Honour of his Son,
to be call’d <i>Antonina</i>. I shall end with this Reflection; That though
all other Cities have their Periods of Government, and are subject to
the Decays of Time, <i>Constantinople</i> alone seems to claim to herself a
kind of Immortality, and will continue a City, as long as the Race of
Mankind shall live either to inhabit or rebuild her.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is recorded by <i>Stephanus</i> and <i>Pausanias</i>, that <i>Byzantium</i>, now
call’d <i>Constantinople</i>, was first founded by <i>Byzas</i> the Son of
<i>Neptune</i> and <i>Ceroessa</i>, or by a Person named <i>Byzes</i>, Admiral of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>Fleet of the <i>Megarians</i>, who transplanted a Colony thither. I am of
Opinion, that this was the same Person with <i>Byzas</i>. For had it taken
its Name from <i>Byzes</i>, this City had more properly been call’d <i>Byzeum</i>
than <i>Byzantium</i>. <i>Philostratus</i>, in the Life of <i>Marcus</i> a Sophist of
<i>Byzantium</i>, calls the Admiral of that Fleet by the Name of <i>Byzas</i>,
when he informs us, that <i>Marcus</i> (whom he would have descended from
the ancient Family of <i>Byzas</i>) made a Voyage to <i>Megara</i>, and was
exceedingly in Favour with the People there, who had formerly sent
over a Colony to <i>Byzantium</i>. This People, when they had consulted
<i>Apollo</i> where they should found a City, received in Answer from the
Oracle, <i>That they should seek out a Situation opposite to the Land
of the Blind</i>. The People of <i>Chalcedon</i> were given to understand by
this mystical Answer, that tho’ they had made a Landing there before,
and had an Opportunity of viewing the commodious Situation of that and
other Places adjacent, yet at last had pitch’d upon the most improper
Place of all. As to what is mention’d by <i>Justin</i>, that <i>Byzantium</i>
was first founded by <i>Pausanias</i> a <i>Spartan</i>, I take it to import no
more than this; that they who affirm that <i>Syca</i>, at present call’d
<i>Galata</i>, was first founded by the <i>Genoese</i>, as was <i>Constantinople</i>
by <i>Constantine</i>, their Meaning was, that they either rebuilt or
enlarged those Places, and not that they were the first Founders
of them. For when I find it in <i>Herodotus</i>, that upon the Invasion
of <i>Thrace</i> by <i>Darius</i>, the People of <i>Byzantium</i> and <i>Chalcedon</i>
were not in the least Expectation of the Arrival of the <i>Phœnician</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>Fleet, that having quitted their Cities, they retired into the Inland
Shores of the <i>Black Sea</i>, and there founded <i>Mesembria</i>, and that
the <i>Phœnicians</i> burnt <i>Byzantium</i>, and <i>Chalcedon</i>; I am of Opinion,
that the <i>Laced&aelig;monians</i>, under the Command of <i>Pausanias</i>, sent a
Colony thither, and rebuilt <i>Byzantium</i>, which was before either a
Colony of the <i>Megarians</i>, or the Seat of the Subjects of <i>Byzas</i>
the Son of <i>Neptune</i>, its first Founder. <i>Eustathius</i> assures us,
that it was anciently called <i>Antonina</i> from <i>Antoninus Bassianus</i>,
the Son of <i>Severus C&aelig;sar</i>, but that it passed under that Name no
longer than his Father liv’d, and that many Years after it was call’d
<i>New Rome</i>, and <i>Constantinople</i>, and <i>Anthusa</i>, or <i>Florentia</i>, by
<i>Constantine the Great</i>; upon which Account it is call’d by <i>Priscian</i>
<i>New Constantinopolitan Rome</i>. It was foretold by the Oracle, that
its Inhabitants should be a successful and flourishing People, but
a constant Course of Prosperity did not always attend them. ’Twas
with great Difficulty that this City first began to make a Figure
in the World, in the Struggles it underwent with the <i>Thracians</i>,
<i>Bithynians</i>, and <i>Gallogrecians</i>, and in paying a yearly Tribute of
eighty Talents to the <i>Gauls</i> who govern’d <i>Asia</i>. ’Twas with greater
Contests that it rose to higher Degrees of Eminency, being frequently
harass’d, not only with foreign, but domestick Enemies. Mighty Changes
it underwent, being sometimes under the popular, sometimes under the
aristocratical Form of Government, widely extending its Conquests in
<i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia</i>, but especially in <i>Bithynia</i>. For <i>Philarcus</i>
observes in the sixth Book of his <i>History</i>, that the <i>Byzantians</i> had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>the same Power over the <i>Bithynians</i>, as the <i>Laced&aelig;monians</i> had over
their <i>Helot&aelig;</i>. This Commonwealth had so great a Veneration for the
<i>Ptolem&aelig;i</i> Kings of <i>&AElig;gypt</i>, that to one of them nam’d <i>Philadelphus</i>,
they pay’d divine Honours, and erected a Temple to him, in the Sight
of their City; and so great a Regard had they for the <i>Roman</i> Name,
that they assisted them against the King of <i>Macedon</i>, to whom,
as degenerating from his Predecessors, they gave the nickname of
<i>Pseudo-Philippus</i>. I need not mention the powerful Succours they sent
against <i>Antiochus</i>, <i>Perseus</i>, <i>Aristonicus</i>, and the Assistance
they gave <i>Antonius</i>, when engaged in a War against the Pyrates. This
City alone stood the Brunt of <i>Mithridates</i>’s whole Army landed in
their Territories, and at last, though with great Difficulty, bravely
repell’d the Invader. It assisted at once <i>Sylla</i>, <i>Lucullus</i> and
<i>Pompey</i>, when they lay’d Siege to any Town or Fortification, which
might be a Security to their auxiliary Forces in their Passage,
either by Sea or Land, or might prove a convenient Port, either for
Exportation or Importation of Provision. Joining its Forces at last
with <i>Niger</i> against <i>Severus</i>, it became subject to the <i>Perinthians</i>,
and was despoil’d of all the Honours of its Government. All its stately
Bagnio’s and Theatres, its strong and lofty Walls, (built of square
Stone, much of the same Hardness with that of a Grindstone, not brought
from <i>Miletus</i>, as <i>Politianus</i> fancies) with which it was fortify’d,
were entirely ruin’d. I say, that this Stone was cut out of no Quarry,
either of ancient <i>Miletus</i>, or <i>Miletopolis</i>; because <i>Miletus</i> lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>at too great a Distance from it, and <i>Miletopolis</i>, which is seated
near the River <i>Rhyndacus</i>, is no ways famous for Quarries. I saw,
by the By, this last City, adjoining to the Lake of <i>Apolloniatus</i>,
entirely demolish’d, retaining at present its Name only. The Walls
of <i>Byzantium</i>, as <i>Herodian</i> relates, were cemented with so thin a
Mortar, that you would by no means think them a conjointed Building,
but one entire Stone. They who saw them in Ruins in <i>Herodian</i>’s Time,
were equally surpriz’d at those who built, and those who defaced them.
<i>Dion</i>, whom <i>Zonaras</i> quotes, reports, that the Walls of <i>Byzantium</i>
were exceeding strong, the Copings of which were built with Stones
three Foot thick, cramp’d together with Links of Brass; and that it
was so firmly compacted inwardly, that the whole Building seem’d to
be one solid Wall. It is adorn’d with numerous and large Towers,
having Gates in them placed one above another. The Walls on the side
of the Continent are very lofty; towards the Sea, not quite so high.
It had two Ports within the Walls, secured with Booms, as was their
Entrance by two high Forts. I had then no Opportunity of consulting
<i>Xenophon</i> in the Original; however I was of Opinion from the <i>Latin</i>
Translation, that a Passage in that Author, which is as follows,
has a Relation to one of those Ports: <i>When the Soldiers</i>, says he,
<i>had passed over from</i> Chrysopolis <i>to</i> Byzantium, <i>and were deny’d
Entrance into the City, they threaten’d to force the Gates, unless the
Inhabitants open’d them of their own Accord; and immediately hastening
to the Sea, they scaled the Walls, and leap’d into the Town, hard by
the Sides of the Port, which the</i> Greeks <i>call</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χηλαὶ</span>, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>is by the Piles; because they jet out into the Sea, winding into the
Figure of a Crab’s Claw. But afterwards meeting with that Author in
<i>Greek</i>, I found no Mention there of the Port, but only <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὴν χηλὴν τοῦ τείχους</span>, that is, near <i>the Copings of the Wall</i>, or rather
the Buttresses that support it. Had it been in the Original <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χηλὴ τοῦ λιμένος</span>, it ought rather to have been translated the <i>Leg</i>,
or the <i>Arm</i>. <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i> mentions, that the first Winding
of the <i>Bosporus</i> contains three Ports. The <i>Byzantians</i> in their time
had five hundred Ships, some of which were two-oar’d Galleys; some
had Rudders both at Stem and Stern, and had also their Pilates at
each, and two Sets of Hands aboard, so that either in an Engagement,
or upon a Retreat, there was no Necessity for them to tack about. The
<i>Byzantians</i>, both in the Life-time and after the Death of <i>Niger</i>,
when besieged for the Space of three Years, acted Wonders; for they
not only took the Enemies Ships as they sail’d by them, but dragg’d
their three-oar’d Galleys from their Moorings; for diving under Water
they cut their Anchors, and by fastening small Ropes from the Stern
round their Ancles, they hall’d off their Ships, which seem’d to swim
merely by the natural Tyde of the Sea. Nor were the <i>Byzantians</i> the
first who practis’d this Stratagem, but the <i>Tyrians</i> frequently,
under a Pretence of gathering Shell-Fish, would play the same Trick;
which <i>Alexander</i> had no sooner discover’d, than he gave Orders that
the Anchors of his whole Fleet, instead of Cables, should be fasten’d
to Iron Chains. In this Siege the <i>Byzantians</i> being reduced to great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>Straits, still refused to surrender, making the best Defence they
could with Timber taken from their Houses. They also breeded Cables
for their Ships out of their Womens Hair; nay sometimes they threw
down Statues and Horses upon the Heads of their Enemies. At last their
Provision being entirely spent, they took up with Hydes soften’d in
Water; and these being gone, they were brought to the extreme Necessity
of eating one another: At last, being wholly reduced by Famine, they
were forced to a Surrender. The <i>Romans</i> gave no Quarter to the
Soldiers, nor the principal Men of the City. The whole Town, with all
its stately Walls in which it glory’d, was levelled with the Ground;
and all its <i>Theatres</i> and <i>Bagnio’s</i> were demolish’d even to the small
Compass of a single Street. <i>Severus</i> was highly pleased with so noble
a Conquest. He took away the Freedom of the City, and having deprived
it of the Dignity of a Commonwealth, he confiscated the Goods of the
Inhabitants; and afterwards making it tributary, he gave it, with
all the neighbouring Countrey, into the Hands of the <i>Perinthians</i>.
Entering the City afterwards, and seeing the Inhabitants coming to meet
him, with Olive-branches in their Hands begging Quarter, and excusing
themselves for making so long a Defence, he forbore the Slaughter; yet
left the <i>Perinthians</i> in the Possession of the Town, allowing them
nevertheless a Theatre, gave Orders for building them a <i>Portico</i> for
Hunting, and a <i>Hippodrom</i>, to which he adjoin’d some <i>Bagnio’s</i>, which
he built near the Temple of <i>Jupiter</i>, who was called <i>Zeuxippus</i>. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>also rebuilt the <i>Strategium</i>; and all the Works that were begun by
<i>Severus</i> in his Life-time, were finish’d by his Son <i>Antoninus</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Extent of Old</i> Byzantium.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE present Inhabitants of <i>Constantinople</i> tell you, that Old
<i>Byzantium</i> stood within the Compass of the first Hill in the Imperial
Precinct, where the <i>Grand Seignor’s Seraglio</i> now stands: but I
am of Opinion, from what follows it will appear, that it was of a
larger Extent. Our modern Writers describe its Situation thus; that
it began at the Wall of the Citadel, stretched itself to the Tower of
<i>Eugenius</i>, and that it rose gradually up to the <i>Strategium</i>, the
<i>Bagnio</i> of <i>Achilles</i>, and the <i>Urbicion</i>. From thence it pass’d on
to the <i>Chalcopratia</i>, and the <i>Miliarium Aureum</i>, where there was
another <i>Urbicion</i> of the <i>Byzantians</i>: Thence it lengthen’d to the
Pillars of <i>Zonarius</i>, from whence, after a gentle Descent, it winded
round by the <i>Mangan&aelig;</i> and the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Arcadius</i>, up to the
<i>Acropolis</i>. I am inclinable to credit all these Writers, excepting
only <i>Eustathius</i>, who tells us, that the <i>Athenians</i> made use of
<i>Byzantium</i>, a small City, to keep their Treasure in. But <i>Zosimus</i>, a
more ancient Historian, describes <i>Byzantium</i> after this Manner: <i>It
was seated</i>, says he, <i>on a Hill, which took up part of the</i> Isthmus,
<i>and was bounded by a Bay called</i> Cheras, <i>and the</i> Propontis. <i>At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>the End of the</i> Portico’s <i>built by</i> Severus <i>the Emperor, it had a
Gate set up, upon his Reconciliation with the Inhabitants, for giving
Protection to</i> Niger <i>his Enemy. The Wall of</i> Byzantium <i>extended
itself from the Eastern Part of the City to the Temple of</i> Venus, <i>and
the Sea over-against</i> Chrysopolis: <i>from the North it descended to
the Dock, and so onward to the Sea, which faces the</i> Black Sea, <i>and
through which you sail into it</i>. This, says he, was the ancient Extent
of the City; but <i>Dionysius</i>, a more ancient Writer than <i>Zosimus</i>, as
appears by his Account, which was written before its Destruction by
<i>Severus</i>, tells us, that <i>Byzantium</i> contain’d in Compass at least
forty Furlongs, which is a much greater Extent than the preceding
Writers reported it. <i>Herodian</i> informs us, that <i>Byzantium</i>, in the
Time of <i>Severus</i>, was the greatest City in all <i>Thrace</i>.</p>

<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Rebuilding of</i> Byzantium <i>by</i> Constantine the Great, <i>and the
Largeness of it in his Time</i>.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">IT is recorded by <i>Zonaras</i>, that <i>Constantine</i> being inclinable
to build a City, and to give it his own Name, at first pitch’d
upon <i>Sardicus</i> a Field of <i>Asia</i>; afterwards, upon the Promontory
<i>Sigeum</i>, and last of all upon <i>Chalcedon</i> and <i>Byzantium</i>, for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>Purpose. <i>Georgius Cedrinus</i> is of Opinion, that he first pitch’d
upon <i>Thessalonica</i>, and after he had lived there two Years, being
wonderfully taken with the Delightfulness of the Place, he built
the most magnificent Temples, <i>Bagnio’s</i> and <i>Aqueducts</i>; but being
interrupted in his great Designs by the Plague which raged there, he
was obliged to leave it, and passing away for <i>Chalcedon</i>, (formerly
overthrown by the <i>Persians</i>, but then upon rebuilding) he was directed
by the Eagles frequently carrying the small Stones of the Workmen
from thence to <i>Byzantium</i>, where <i>Constantinople</i> ought to be built.
<i>Zonaras</i> is of the same Opinion; and only differs as to the Story
of the Stones, and says, that they were small Ropes which they used
in Building. But this seems to be a Fable taken out of <i>Dionysius</i> a
<i>Byzantian</i> Writer, who tells us, that <i>Byzas</i> had been the Founder of
<i>Byzantium</i>, in a Place call’d <i>Semystra</i>, seated at the Mouth of the
Rivers <i>Cydarus</i> and <i>Barbysa</i>, had not a Crow, by snatching a Piece
of the Sacrifice out of the Flames, and carrying it to a Promontory of
the <i>Bosporus</i>, directed <i>Byzas</i> to found <i>Byzantium</i> in that Place.
But <i>Constantine</i> does not seem to me to have been so oversighted as
were the ancient <i>Chalcedonians</i>, for which they stand recorded in
the Histories of all Ages. Nay, ’tis distinguishable by any Man of
a tolerable Judgment, that <i>Byzantium</i> was a much more commodious
Situation for the <i>Roman</i> Empire than that of <i>Chalcedon</i>. The far
more ancient Historians, among whom are <i>Sozomen</i> of <i>Salamis</i> and
<i>Zosimus</i>, who wrote in the Reign of <i>Theodosius the Less</i>, judged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>more rationally on this Occasion. They tell us, without taking any
Notice of <i>Sardica</i>, <i>Thessalonica</i> or <i>Chalcedon</i>, that <i>Constantine</i>
debating with himself, where he might build a City, and call it by
his own Name, equal in Glory and Magnificence to that of <i>Rome</i>, had
found out a convenient Situation for that Purpose, between old <i>Troy</i>
and the <i>Hellespont</i>; that he had lay’d the Foundations, and raised
part of the Wall to a considerable Height, which is to be seen at this
Day on the Promontory <i>Sigeum</i>, which <i>Pliny</i> calls <i>Ajantium</i>; because
the Sepulchre of <i>Ajax</i>, which was in that Place, hung over the Chops
of the <i>Hellespont</i>: They tell you farther, that anciently some Ships
were station’d there, and that the <i>Grecians</i>, when at War with the
<i>Trojans</i>, pitch’d their Tents in that Place: That <i>Constantine</i>
afterwards came into an Opinion, that <i>Byzantium</i> was a properer
Situation; that three hundred and sixty two Years after the Reign of
<i>Augustus</i>, he rebuilt, enlarged and fortified it with great and strong
Walls, and by an Edict engraven on a Stone Pillar, and publickly fix’d
up in the <i>Strategium</i>, near his own <i>Equestrian</i> Statue, order’d it
to be called <i>Nova Roma Constantinopolitana</i>. Upon a Computation made,
that the Natives were not a sufficient Number to people the City, he
built several fine Houses in and about the <i>Forums</i>, of which he made a
Present to the Senators and other Men of Quality, which he brought with
him from <i>Rome</i> and other Nations. He built also several <i>Forums</i>, some
as an Ornament, others for the Service of the City. The <i>Hippodrom</i> he
beautify’d with Temples, Fountains, <i>Portico’s</i>, and a Senate-House,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>and allow’d its Members equal Honours and Privileges with those of
<i>Rome</i>. He also built himself a Palace, little inferior to the Royal
one at <i>Rome</i>. In short, he was so ambitious to make it rival <i>Rome</i>
itself in all its Grandeur and Magnificence, that at length, as
<i>Sozomen</i> assures us, it far surpassed it, both in the Number of its
Inhabitants, and its Affluence of all Kinds. <i>Eunapius</i> a <i>Sardian</i>, no
mean Writer, nay though an Enemy to <i>Constantine</i>, describes the vast
Extent of <i>Constantinople</i>, in these Words: <i>Constantinople</i>, says he,
<i>formerly called</i> Byzantium, <i>allow’d the ancient</i> Athenians <i>a Liberty
of importing Corn in great Quantities; but at present not all the Ships
of Burthen from</i> &AElig;gypt, Asia, Syria, Phœnicia, <i>and many other Nations,
can import a Quantity sufficient for the Support of those People, whom</i>
Constantine, <i>by unpeopling other Cities, has transported thither</i>.
<i>Zosimus</i> also, though otherwise no very good Friend to <i>Constantine</i>
on the score of his Religion, yet frankly owns, that he wonderfully
enlarged it; and that the <i>Isthmus</i> was enclosed by a Wall from Sea
to Sea, to the Distance of fifteen Furlongs beyond the Walls of old
<i>Byzantium</i>. But to what Extent soever <i>Constantine</i> might enlarge its
Bounds, yet the Emperors who succeeded him have extended them farther,
and have enclosed the City with much wider Walls than those built by
<i>Constantine</i>, and permitted them to build so closely one House to
another, and that even in their Market Places, that they could not
walk the Streets without Danger, they were so crowded with Men and
Cattle. Upon this Account it was, that a great part of the Sea which
runs round the City was in some Places dry’d up, where by fixing Posts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>in a circular Manner, and building Houses upon them, they made their
City large enough for the Reception of an infinite Multitude of People.
Thus does <i>Zosimus</i> express himself as to the vast Extent of this
City, as it stood in the Time either of <i>Arcadius</i> or <i>Theodosius</i>.
<i>Agathius</i> says, that in the Time of <i>Justinian</i> the Buildings were
so close and crowded together, that it was very difficult to see the
Sky by looking through the Tops of them. The large Compass of this
City before <i>Justinian</i>’s Time, we may in some measure collect from
an <i>ancient Description of the City</i>, by an unknown but seemingly a
very faithful Writer. He assures us, that the Length of the City from
the <i>Porta Aurea</i> to the Sea Shore in a direct Line, was fourteen
thousand and seventy five Feet, and that it was six thousand one
hundred and fifty Feet in Breadth. And yet we cannot collect plainly
from <i>Procopius</i>, that in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i> the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>
were enclosed within the Walls, although before his Time the City was
enlarged by <i>Theodosius the Less</i>, who as <i>Zonaras</i> and others write,
gave Orders to <i>Cyrus</i> the Governour of the City for that Purpose. This
Man, with great Diligence and wonderful Dispatch, built a Wall over the
Continent from Sea to Sea, in sixty Days. The Inhabitants astonish’d
that so immense a Work should be finish’d in so small a Time, cry’d out
in a publick manner in the Theatre, in the Presence of <i>Theodosius</i> the
Emperor, <i>Constantine built this City, but</i> Cyrus <i>rebuilt it</i>. This
drew on him the Envy of his Prince, and render’d him suspected; so that
being shaved by the Command of <i>Theodosius</i>, against his Inclinations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>he was constituted Bishop of <i>Smyrna</i>. The following Inscriptions
made to <i>Constantinus</i>, and carv’d over the Gate of <i>Xylocerum</i> and
<i>Rhegium</i>, take Notice of him in these Verses.</p>

<p class="noindent">Over the Gate of <i>Xylocerum</i> (<i>Xylocercum</i> or <i>Xylocricum</i>) in
<i>Byzantium</i>, thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The Reason why <i>Constantine</i> order’d <i>Byzantium</i> to be call’d <i>New
Rome</i>, or <i>Queen</i> of the <i>Roman Empire</i>, is mention’d by <i>Sozomen</i>
and others; namely, that God appear’d by Night to <i>Constantine</i>, and
advised him to build a City at <i>Byzantium</i> worthy his own Name. Some
say, that as <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, upon a Plot form’d against him, judg’d it
necessary to remove to <i>Alexandria</i> or <i>Troy</i>, stripping <i>Italy</i> at
the same time of every thing that was valuable, and carrying off all
the Riches of the <i>Roman</i> Empire, leaving the Administration in the
Hands of his Friends; so it is said of <i>Constantine</i>, that perceiving
himself to be obnoxious to the People of <i>Rome</i>, having drain’d the
City of all its Wealth, went over at first to <i>Troy</i>, and afterwards
to <i>Byzantium</i>. <i>Zosimus</i>, an implacable Enemy to the Christian Name,
alledges an execrable Piece of Villany, as the Cause of his Removal.
<i>Constantine</i>, says he, <i>when he had murder’d</i> Crispus, <i>and had
been guilty of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span> flagrant Crimes, desiring of the Priests an
Expiation for them, their Answer was, That his Offences were so many
and enormous, that they knew not which way to atone for them; telling
him at the same time, that there was a certain</i> &AElig;gyptian <i>who came
from</i> Spain <i>to</i> Rome; <i>who, if he had an Opportunity of speaking to
him, could procure him an Expiation, if he would establish in his
Dominions this Belief of the</i> Christians, <i>namely, That Men of the
most profligate Lives, immediately upon their Repentance, obtain’d
Remission of Sins</i>. Constantine <i>readily closed with this Offer, and
his Sins were pardon’d. At the Approach of the Festival, on which it
was usual with him and his Army to go up to the Capitol, to perform
the customary Rites of their Religion</i>; Constantine <i>fearful to be
present at that Solemnity, as being warn’d to the contrary by a Dream,
which was sent him from the</i> &AElig;gyptian, <i>and not attending the holy
Sacrifice, highly disgusted the Senate, and the whole Body of the
People of</i> Rome. <i>But unable to bear the Curses and Scandal they threw
upon him on that Account, he went in Search of some Place or other
equally famous with</i> Rome, <i>where he might build him a Palace, and
which he might make the Seat of the</i> Roman <i>Empire, and that at last he
had discovered a Place between</i> Troas <i>and Old</i> Ilium, <i>fit for that
Purpose; and that there he built him a Palace, laid the Foundations of
a City, and raised part of a Wall for its Defence: But that afterwards
disapproving the Situation, he left his Works unfinish’d, and settled
at</i> Byzantium; <i>and being wonderfully taken with the Agreeableness of
the Place, he judged it in all respects to be very commodious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> for
an Imperial Seat</i>. Thus far <i>Zosimus</i>, a great Favourite of <i>Julian</i>
the Apostate, and an inveterate Enemy to <i>Constantine</i> on the account
of his Religion; to whose Sentiments I have so perfect an Aversion,
that I cannot give the least Credit to those Enormities he charges
him with, and of which he had the greatest Abhorrence, as being a
Prince of remarkable Clemency and Goodness, which I am capable of
proving abundantly, but that it would prove too great a Digression
in the present History. The Truth of it is, that <i>Sozomen</i> and
<i>Evagrius</i> both have sufficiently refuted these malicious Reflections.
In these Calumnies, I say, I entirely differ from <i>Zosimus</i>, yet in
his Description of the Extent, and Compass of the City, I am wholly
in his Opinion; who, though an Enemy to <i>Constantine</i>, yet is forced
to acknowledge him to have built so large, so noble, so magnificent
a City. I am the more induced to give Credit to his History in this
Respect, because he lived many Ages nearer to the Time of <i>Constantine</i>
than our modern <i>Monks</i>, who, in the Books they have written of
<i>Constantinople</i>, give the following Account of it; namely, that
<i>Constantine</i> built a Wall from the Tower of <i>Eugenius</i> (which was the
Boundary of old <i>Byzantium</i>) to St. <i>Anthony</i>’s Church, and the Church
of the <i>Blessed Virgin</i>, call’d <i>Rabdon</i>, quite up to the <i>Exacionion</i>;
and that at a Mile’s Distance, it passed on to the old Gates of the
Church of St. <i>John</i> the <i>Baptist</i>, stretching itself farther to the
Cistern of <i>Bonus</i>, from whence it extended itself to the <i>Armation</i>,
and so winded round to St. <i>Anthony</i>’s Church again. I should give my
self the Trouble to examine this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> Account, but that I know the Authors
are so fabulous, that they are no ways to be depended upon. But this I
look upon to be an intolerable Blunder, that they place the Church of
St. <i>John Baptist</i> within the Walls built by <i>Constantine</i>, whereas for
many Years after his Death it continued without the City: Of which, and
many other Errors, I shall take Notice in the following History.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="chapter" id="Book_I_Chap_IV"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of the present Figure, Compass, Length and Breadth of</i>
Constantinople.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Figure of <i>Constantinople</i> is triangular, the Base of which is that
Part of it which lies Westward: The top Angle points to the East,
where the <i>Peninsula</i> begins. But both the Sides of this Triangle are
not equal; for that Side which lies westward winds round the Angle
of the Bay in the Figure of a Half-Moon. At a great Distance from
thence, it winds about again from North to South. But the South Side
of this Triangle veers about to such a Breadth, that if you should
draw a strait Line from one Angle of it to the other, it would cut off
a Creek, which, in the Middle of it, is at least a quarter of a Mile
over. But that Side which faces the North, and is call’d <i>Ceras</i>, the
Bay or Horn, should you draw a strait Line over it from one Angle to
another, it would cut off not only the whole Bay, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span> a part of
<i>Galata</i>. For this Side inflects inwards in such a manner, that from
each Point it circulates in the Form of a Bow, having two smaller
Windings of the same Figure in the Middle of it, but lies inwardly into
the Continent so far, that the two Horns or Ends of the Bow, which
includes them, no ways intercept the Prospect of the Angles of the
larger Arch. ’Tis upon this Account that <i>Constantinople</i> may rather
seem to be of a triarcular, than a triangular Figure. For right Angles
never project beyond their Sides, nor do they inflect inwards. But all
semicircular Figures are in a manner both convex and concave also. So
that if these three Angles, so far as they project beyond the main
Body of the City, were divided from it, <i>Constantinople</i> would form a
square oblong Figure, little more than a Mile broad, and almost three
times as long. But be that as it will, all are of Opinion, that this
City ought to be look’d upon to be of a triangular Figure, because
it has three Sides; one of which that faces the <i>Propontis</i>, and the
other on the side of the <i>Thracian</i> Continent, are of an equal Length;
the third, adjoining to the Bay, is about a Mile shorter than the
other two. This City is computed to be near thirteen Miles in Compass,
although <i>Laonicus Chalcondylus</i>, in his History of the <i>Ottomans</i>,
assures us, that <i>Constantinople</i> contain’d in Compass an hundred and
eleven Furlongs; the Length of it, extending itself over the Promontory
with six Hills, is no more than thirty Furlongs; but if the Figure
of it was an equilateral Triangle, it would not be much above nine
Miles in Circumference; and could we suppose its hilly Situation to
be widen’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> into one large Plain, yet then it would not be so large
in Compass as the Inhabitants generally reckon it, <i>viz.</i> eighteen
Miles. It is observable, that <i>Constantinople</i> does not contain more
Bays of Building, as it is situate upon Hills, than it would if it
were built upon a Plain; because you cannot so conveniently build upon
a Declivity, as you can upon a Level. Nor does the Reason equally
hold good, as to the Number of its Houses, and the Number of its
Inhabitants. For <i>Constantinople</i> can contain more Men as it is seated
upon Hills, than it could if it were seated on a Plain. The Breadth of
this City varies in several Places. From the East to the Middle of it,
’tis at least a Mile in Breadth, but in no Place broader than a Mile
and a half. It divides itself afterwards into two Branches, where ’tis
almost as broad as ’tis long. I can compare it, as to its Figure, to
nothing more properly than to an Eagle stretching out his Wings, and
looking obliquely to the left, upon whose Beak stands the first Hill,
where is the <i>Grand Seignor’s</i> Palace. In his Eye stands the Church of
St. <i>Sophia</i>; on the lower part of the Head is the <i>Hippodrom</i>; upon
his Neck are the second and third Hills, and the remaining part of the
City fill up his Wings, and his whole Body.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>A general Description of</i> Constantinople.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2"><span class="smcap">Constantinople</span> takes up in Compass the whole <i>Peninsula</i>,
which contains seven Hills, of which the eastern Angle of the City
includes one, having its Rise at the Promontory, which <i>Pliny</i> calls
<i>Chrysoceras</i>, and <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i>, <i>Bosporium</i>. The first
Hill is divided from the second by a broad Valley; the Promontory of
<i>Bosporium</i> contains the other six, extending itself from the Entrance
of the <i>Peninsula</i> on the East, full West with a continued Ridge, but
somewhat convex’d, and hangs over the Bay. Six Hills and five Valleys
shoot from the right Side of it, and ’tis divided only by the third and
fifth Valleys on the left Side of it, which is all upon the Descent,
and has only some small Hills and Vales, which are more steep than
the Hills themselves. It has also two Windings which take their Rise
from the Top of the first Hill, from whence it ascends by Degrees
almost to another Winding, which begins from the Top of the third
Hill, where sinking into a gentle Descent, it admits the Valley, which
lies between the third and the fourth Hill. From thence it rises again
with a moderate Ascent, and continues upon a Level westward almost
to the <i>Urbicion</i>, where it rises again. The Plains adjoining to the
Promontory differ as to their Level. Those that divide the Promontory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
at the Top, and those at the Foot of it, are very uneven in many
Places. The Plain at the Top of the first Hill is seven hundred Paces
in Length, and two hundred in Breadth. Shooting hence, it rises almost
insensibly to the Top of the second Hill, where ’tis five hundred
Paces in Breadth, and is all upon the Descent to the Top of that Hill,
where the second Valley, which is also shelving and very narrow, takes
its Rise. On the third Hill the Plain is above six hundred Paces in
Breadth, but somewhat more upon the Level at the Entrance of the third
Valley, which is six hundred Paces broad. From hence you rise by a
gentle Ascent to the Plain on the Top of the fourth Hill, which is not
above two hundred Paces wide. On the fifth Hill it dilates itself to
the Breadth of seven hundred Paces. On the Hill, from whence the fifth
Valley takes its Rise, ’tis more narrow; and on the sixth Hill ’tis a
little upon the Ascent again. As to the Plain, which extends itself
between the Sea and the Bottom of the <i>Promontory</i>, that also is not so
even in some Places as it is in others; for it is narrower under the
Hills, in the Vales ’tis half as wide again. For winding itself from
the <i>Promontory</i>, where it begins, over three Valleys, it is widen’d
at that Distance into the Breadth of a thousand Paces, though at the
Foot of the Hills it is not above an Acre, or a hundred and twenty Foot
in Breadth, except at the Bottom of the third and fifth Hills, where
’tis very narrow, but extends itself over the fourth Valley both in
Length and Breadth to a great Degree. At the Foot of the sixth Hill
it contracts itself again, except at the Foot of two lesser Hills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
situated behind the first and second Hills; one of which projects
almost to the Sea, the other is at no great Distance from it. But to
describe <i>Constantinople</i> in a more easy and comprehensive Manner, I
will give the Reader a particular Account of all its Hills and Vales,
which indeed make a very lovely and agreeable Prospect. For the six
Hills which shoot from the <i>Promontory</i>, (and which for their Likeness
you might call Brothers) stand in so regular an Order, that neither
of them intercepts the Prospect of the other; so that as you sail up
the Bay, you see them all hanging over it in such a manner, that quite
round the City you see before you both Sides of every one of them. The
first of these Hills jets out to the East, and bounds the Bay; the
second and third lie more inward to the South; the others lie more open
to the North, so that at one View you have a full Prospect of them.
The first lies lower than the second; the second than the third; the
fourth, fifth and sixth are in some Places higher, in others somewhat
lower than the third, which you may discover by the Level of the
Aqueduct. That the first Hill is lower than the third and fourth, may
be discover’d by the Tower which supports the Aqueduct, by which the
Water is raised into the Air above fifty Foot high. To make this more
intelligible, I will divide the City, as to the Length of it, from the
Land’s Point on the Shore of the <i>Bosporus</i>, to the Walls on the Neck
of the <i>Isthmus</i>, and consider the Breadth of it, as it widens from
the <i>Propontis</i> to the Bay called <i>Ceras</i>. The Reason why I divide the
City, as to its Breadth, into six Parts, is the natural Situation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the <i>Promontory</i>, which itself is divided into six Hills, with Valleys
running between them. It was no great Difficulty to distinguish the
<i>Roman</i> Hills, because they were entirely disjoin’d by Valleys; but
’tis not so easy to distinguish those of <i>Constantinople</i>, because they
are conjoin’d at Top; and besides, the Backs of them do not project
in so mountainous a manner as they do in the Front; so that I cannot
better describe them, than by calling them a continued Ridge of Hills,
divided each of them with Valleys. And therefore to proceed regularly,
I shall first give the Reader a Description of the right Side of the
<i>Promontory</i>, with its Hills and Vales, and then take Notice of the
left Side of it, which stands behind them.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Situation of all the Parts of the
City describ’d.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE first Part of the Breadth of the <i>Promontory</i> is the Front of it,
which opening to the Distance of a thousand Paces Eastwards adjoins to
the Chaps of the <i>Bosporus</i>. For this Sea winds round the Back of the
<i>Promontory</i> in such a Manner, that from the Point where the <i>Bosporus</i>
is divided, to the Bay called <i>Ceras</i>, and the Land’s Point of that
Sea, it extends itself from North to South to the Distance of fourteen
Furlongs; and from thence to a farther Distance of four Furlongs, it
winds round from the South-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> to the South-South-west, even to the
Mouth of the <i>Propontis</i>, which joining with the <i>Bosporus</i>, winds
round the City to South-west, to the Distance of two Miles more. This
Side of the Hill is bounded at the Bottom of it with a Plain of the
same Breadth with itself, which is two hundred Paces. There rise upon
the Plain some lesser Hills, which are not above four hundred Paces
in Height. On the Top of the left Side of these Hills stands the
<i>Hippodrom</i>; on the right Side, which faces the South-west, is the
Palace of the <i>Grand Seignor</i>. I might not improperly call it the Front
of the <i>Promontory</i>, as being almost of an equal Ascent in all its
Parts, having a Plain running along it, of an equal Length with itself;
besides, it adjoins to the first Hill: I say, for these Reasons I might
call it a part of the first Hill; but to understand it more distinctly,
I shall treat of it by itself.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the first Hill, of the Palace of the
Grand Seignor, of the Church of St.</i>
Sophia, <i>and the</i> Hippodrom.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE first Hill, extending itself from the South-east to the South-west,
opens at the Entrance of it to the Breadth of thirty Paces; from
thence it widens gradually, and so on, till at last ’tis almost as
broad as ’tis long. It rises at the Nook of the <i>Isthmus</i>, which joins
the <i>Peninsula</i> to the Continent. It projects itself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span> Form of
a Cymetar, or a Hawk’s Beak, and almost divides the Straits of the
<i>Bosporus</i>, and the Bay called <i>Ceras</i>. The whole Hill projects beyond
the others almost to the Mouth of the Bay. ’Tis all upon a Descent,
except the Top of it, where there’s a Plain which joins to the Plain
of the <i>Promontory</i>. The lesser Eminences which stand upon it, and
which face the East and the North, have a moderate Descent, others of
them are more steep, so that in some Places you are obliged to climb
them by Steps, but the tallest of them is not above four hundred Paces
high. The Plain, at the Foot of this Hill, is very different. The
Eastern Part of it is much widen’d by the Sea Shore, which jets out
in a semicircular Manner. The Breadth of the South-east and northern
Part of it is encreased by the Valley, which divides the first from the
second Hill. The Plain on the Top of the Hill is about seven hundred
Paces in Length. This Hill is not only fortified by Nature, as being
encompassed on the East by the <i>Bosporus</i>, on the North by the Bay
of <i>Ceras</i>, and on the West by a cool Valley; but ’tis also inclosed
within the Walls of the <i>Seraglio</i>, which are guarded with numberless
Ramparts and Towers, which are equal in Strength to the Walls of the
City. Towards the Foot of the Hill, and the Plain near the Sea, lie
the Gardens of the <i>Grand Seignor</i>. The Imperial Palace, which is
partly situate on the Top of the Hill, and partly on the Eminences
below it, affords almost an unmeasurable Prospect, both by Sea and
Land. In this Plain there are two Imperial <i>Areas</i> or Courts; the first
of these Courts is seven hundred Paces long, and two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> broad.
You pass through this into another inner Court, which is a Quadrangle
two hundred Paces long, and has round it a magnificent <i>Portico</i>,
supported with a Multitude of fine Marble Pillars curiously variegated.
In the Middle of the Court there’s a fine shady Walk of <i>Plane</i> and
<i>Cypress-Trees</i> for the Lawyers, and in the North Angle of the City
is the <i>Forum Judiciale</i>, which the <i>Ottomans</i> call their <i>Divan</i>.
On the South-east Side of a large Court stands the magnificent and
stately Palace of the <i>Grand Seignor</i>, on the North Side of which are
built many Imperial <i>Bagnio’s</i>, and Kitchens with eight arch’d Roofs,
rising like a <i>Cupola</i>, in an hemispherical Manner; each of these
<i>Cupola’s</i> representing the Figure of a little House, is nothing else
but a Chimney with Windows, light at Top, made in the Likeness of a
Lantern. There is a two-leav’d Iron Gate which lets you into the first
Court, the Leaves of it, when opened, stand at twenty Paces Distance.
The Porters or <i>Capoochees</i> stand always upon Duty at these Gates.
Just above them the Hill rises up to a smooth Level with the Ridge of
the <i>Promontory</i>. The Porch or Gate-house is lined on each Side with
glittering Armour, and shines, as do also the Jambs of the Gate with
rich Marble. Over the Porch there rises a square Building cover’d
with Lead, as are all the other Edifices of the Palace. There’s a
Passage out of the first Court through another two-leav’d Gate into the
second inner Court. This is the Station of the <i>Drudging Porters</i>. The
Gate-house here also blazes with refulgent Arms. This Gate, without
side of it, has nothing like a Porch, though within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span> side it has. ’Tis
supported with ten Pillars of different Kinds of Marble; the Roof of it
proudly glitters with Gold, and is beautify’d with the most rich and
lively Colours of <i>Persian</i> Work. At the third Gate, where the Entrance
opens into the <i>Seraglio</i>, there are other Porters or <i>Capoochees</i>
attending. These are under the Command of the <i>Capoochee-Basha</i>, or
Captain of the Porters, who is also Chamberlain to the <i>Grand Seignor</i>.
No body is suffer’d to enter the Palace without his Permission, but the
Servants and Officers of the Houshold, unless it be his Noblemen, who
while he is sitting near the Door of the <i>Seraglio</i>, may freely enter
to pay their Homage to him. All Ambassadors, when introduced into his
Presence, are allow’d to kiss his Hand, who receives them sitting upon
a low Couch, but curiously embroider’d, in a little Apartment built
with Marble, adorn’d with Gold and Silver, and sparkling with Diamonds
and precious Stones. This Room of State is incircled with a <i>Portico</i>,
which is supported with Pillars of the finest Marble, the Capitals and
Pedestals of which are all gilded. Besides these I have mention’d,
there are many other Gates round the <i>Seraglio</i>, through which none
are admitted, but such as are in the highest Favour with the Emperour.
If I mistake not, I counted twelve, which were all Iron-work; seven of
them were near the City; two of them, through which they carried their
Hay to the <i>Seraglio</i>, were near the Sea; on the Sea Side there were
five more: The first of these stands to the North of the <i>Seraglio</i>,
towards the Bay; the second stands upon the Ridge of a Hill: ’Tis
very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span> large, has a Porch with an arch’d Roof before it, is gilded, and
adorn’d in a surprizing manner with <i>Persian</i> Paintings, supported with
Pillars of <i>Ophitick</i> Marble, and looks into the <i>Bosporus</i>. At some
Distance Eastward there is another Gate facing <i>Chalcedon</i>. Just before
it the Vessels are moor’d, in which the <i>Grand Seignor</i> sails to some
distant Shore, when he goes a hunting, or is inclined to divert himself
in his Gardens. The fourth Gate stands South-east near the Ruins of
a <i>Christian</i> Church, some Tokens of which are still remaining in a
Wall, to which the <i>Greeks</i> to this Day, by their frequent Visits,
continue to pay a kind of devotional Reverence. Beyond this there is a
fifth Port or Gate, where is built a Room, though it is only rafter’d,
whence you may have the Diversion of seeing the Fish catch’d; as it
is also a kind of Repository, where the <i>Grand Seignor’s</i> Fishermen
lay up their Tackle. I would observe by the By, that though all the
Hills of <i>Constantinople</i> afford a very pleasing Prospect, yet there is
none which entertains you with such peculiar Delectation as the first
Hill, where the <i>Sultan</i> lives in a licentious and luxurious manner.
He has before him, whether he is walking in his Gardens, or in his
Chambers of the <i>Seraglio</i>, a full View of the <i>Bosporus</i> and both its
Shores, which are green, and flourishing with Woods belonging to the
neighbouring Farms. On the right Hand he beholds a spacious Field of
<i>Chalcedon</i>, cover’d with his own Gardens; he sees the <i>Propontis</i>,
Islands without Number, and the woody Mountains of <i>Asia</i>. If he looks
at an immense Distance, behind him he beholds the <i>Olympus</i> always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
cloath’d in Snow. If he takes a shorter Prospect, he views before
him the Wonders of his own City, the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i> and the
<i>Hippodrom</i>. If he casts his Eyes to the left Hand, he beholds the
seven Hills on which the City is seated, and more remotely, he looks
round the unmeasurable spacious Fields of <i>Thracia</i>. If he extends
his Prospect over the Seas, he views a moving Scene of Ships passing
and repassing before him; some sailing from the <i>Hellespont</i>, or the
<i>Black Sea</i>, others again coming into his Port from all the Coasts
of the <i>Propontis</i>, while other Vessels at the same time are sailing
up and down the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, where there are also abundance of
Wherries and small Boats always oaring from Side to Side. And if he
looks below him, he has the agreeable Pleasure of beholding the three
Sides of the first Hill, dressed with Trees, Flowers and Plants of
all Kinds. But he has not only a fine Prospect from the Palace, but
is entertain’d with several delightful <i>Visto’s</i> from the Top of the
Gardens rising on the Hills. If he has an Inclination to take a View
of his <i>Seraglio</i>, from that Point of Land which projects so far into
the Sea, and which, as I observ’d, divided the <i>Bosporus</i>; here he
beholds it in all its Glory, strengthen’d with large Pillars of Marble,
and fann’d with gentle refreshing Breezes, where he often sits with
small Osier Lattices before him; so that, like another <i>Gyges</i>, he
discerns all that sail near him, though he himself is visible to none:
And if at any time he is weary of the Company of his Domesticks, he
can divert himself with the ridiculous Drollery of the Watermen, when
fixing their Oars and Boat-poles to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> the Shore, they tug against the
violent Stream of the <i>Bosporus</i>, which is much more rapid than the
<i>Rhone</i>. Without the <i>Seraglio</i> stands the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>,
which is about seventy Paces distant from the Gate of the first Court.
’Tis situate on the Brow of the first Hill, upon an Eminence that
hangs over the Garden of the first Valley: From thence you ascend
by Stone Steps to the Gate of the <i>Seraglio</i>, and the Church of St.
<i>Sophia</i>, which from the South-east falls with so easy a Descent, that
it almost imperceptibly terminates on a Plain both above and below it.
In short, all the Descents from the Imperial Palace to the <i>Hippodrom</i>,
are moderate and gentle. South-west of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, a
Plain extends itself to the End of the <i>Hippodrom</i>, which is above
seven hundred Paces long. The <i>Hippodrom</i> is more than two Furlongs in
Length, and one Furlong in Breadth. It stands upon a perfect Level; but
this is more to be ascribed to Industry, than its natural Situation.
The Middle Part of it, stretching as far as the <i>Propontis</i>, on three
Sides of it, is a shelving Ground. On the East it falls with a small
Declivity, on the West ’tis more upon the Descent, on the Side of the
<i>Propontis</i> ’tis directly perpendicular to the Depth, more or less, of
fifty Foot. The whole Front of the <i>Hippodrom</i> is built upon Arches,
(which makes it stand upon a Level) and entertains the Spectator with a
very delectable Prospect of the <i>Propontis</i>, so that you may not only
see Men sailing to and fro before you, but may also see the Dolphins
frequently tumbling about the Waters. The Steps on the North Side of
the <i>Hippodrom</i>, which remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> there but a few Years since, were
demolished by <i>Abraham</i> the <i>Bassa</i>, and were used in building his own
House. Between the <i>Hippodrom</i> and the <i>Propontis</i> there stretches a
Plain, which widens to the Breadth of four hundred Paces, where the
Churches of <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Sergius</i> anciently stood; of both which I
shall take Notice in the following History. Below the <i>Hippodrom</i>, to
the South, is the Gate call’d <i>Porta Leonis</i>, which is situate without
the City, upon the Ruins of the Palace of <i>Leo Macellus</i>; the Windows
of which, of antique Workmanship, are still remaining in the Walls. The
Palace was built upon a Hill adjoining to the Sea, which was about a
hundred Paces high.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the first Valley.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">FROM the uppermost Plain of the <i>Promontory</i>, on which, as I observed,
stood the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i> and the <i>Hippodrom</i>, by an easy Ascent
of a thousand Paces, you climb the Ridge of the second Hill up to the
<i>Porphyry</i> Pillar, erected on the Top of the second Hill, which is
bounded on the East by the first Valley, which divides the first from
the second Hill. It rises at the Plain of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and extends
itself from South to North. This Valley represents exactly the Figure
of the Letter V; one of whose Sides extends itself full East, the other
North. Thro’ the Middle of it runs the Wall, which divides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> <i>Grand
Seignor</i>’s Palace from the rest of the City. The lowermost Plain of
the <i>Promontory</i> extends itself in Length and Breadth so far into this
Valley, that from the Bay to the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, you may walk
a thousand Paces almost upon the Level. From the Entrance of it on the
Sea Side, ’tis all a plain Ground to the Length of five hundred Paces;
afterwards winding itself into this Vale, it rises with a small Ascent,
which is more easily perceivable by a gentle Fall of the Water, than by
the Eye or Foot. At the Beginning of it ’tis somewhat wide, afterwards
’tis narrower, and at the End of it ’tis straighten’d into two lesser
Valleys; one of which, near to the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, is four
hundred Paces long. It rises gradually, and is so very narrow, that the
publick Way takes up the whole Breadth of it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="chapter" id="Book_I_Chap_IX"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of the second Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Ridge of the <i>Promontory</i> rising a little higher, and the two
Valleys adjoining to it, make the second Hill. The first Valley
divides, at East, the first from the second Hill; the other Valley,
Westward, divides the second from the third. On the North ’tis bounded
by a Plain on the Sea Shore. The Ridge of the <i>Promontory</i> extends from
South to North to the Distance of one thousand Paces in Length, and
four hundred in Breadth. The different Breadth of the Vales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> varies
the Breadth of the whole Hill. For where the Valleys which bound the
Sides of it at the Top are more contracted, the Hill widens, and at
the Foot of the Hill, where they are much wider, the Hill is less.
The lesser Hills which stand upon it, extend its Length, two of which
hang over the Bay. Its Height varies according to the different Height
of the three Clifts, or small Hills which rise upon it. For the Clift
lying to the South-east, rises moderately, from the lowest part of the
Valley to the Top of the Hill, to the Height of about a thousand Paces;
afterwards, as the Valley widens, it grows less, and is rendered more
steep by two small Valleys (branching out of the great Valley) which
indeed are somewhat upon the Descent, but not above a hundred Paces
high. The different Heights of the Clifts which hang over the Bay, may
be best discover’d by considering the different Heights of the five
<i>publick Ways</i>, which reach from the Ridge to the Foot of the Hill.
The first of these Ways rises to the Height of five hundred Paces, two
hundred of which from the Foot of the Hill are very easy of Ascent, the
other three hundred are very steep. The second <i>Road</i> is six hundred
Paces high, a hundred of which rise through the lowest of the small
Valleys by a gentle Ascent, the next hundred are almost perpendicular,
so that you must climb them by Steps; the other four hundred rise
gradually to the Top of the Hill, which is sixty Paces in Breadth. This
Hill, on the Ridge of it, shoots Southward to the Distance of a hundred
and fifty Paces, quite from the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i> to the <i>Porphyry
Pillar</i>. The other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span> three <i>publick Ways</i>, from the Bottom of the Hill,
are for the first hundred Paces upon a gentle Rise, the next two
hundred are a mighty Declivity, so that you are obliged to ascend them
by Windings and Turnings; the remaining five hundred, up to the Plain
upon the Hill, rise moderately. I would observe farther, that on the
Side of the Clifts which project over the Bay, two small Hills jetted
out, one to the North, and the other to the East; both which uniting
form a little Valley, which is bounded on the East by a Hill which
rises eighty Paces in Height, and has in some Places very agreeable
Descents. This is the Reason that most part of the lesser Clifts, which
bear upon this Hill, stand to the East, and that the Side of the Hill
which looks Westward, is in some Parts of it more shelving than in
other: For its Eminencies falling into the lowest Plain in the Valley,
to the Length of three hundred Paces, from the Foot of the Hill up to
the Middle of it, are almost perpendicular, and from the Middle to the
Top they slope but little. As for those Hills which project over the
Head of the Valley, they are not above two hundred Paces high, often
of a different Ascent: For as the Valley rises, the Clifts seem lower.
Indeed all the lesser Clifts of this Hill have a double Descent; one
length-ways, and the other broad-ways: For those of them which stand
East and West are seated in such a manner, that they also lye to the
North. In short, all the Sides of this Hill, in the most steep Ascents
of them, are not above a Furlong in Height; in other Places they fall
into a moderate Declivity, and at the Bottom of them they gradually
enlarge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> themselves into a Plain. The upper Clifts at the Top of them
are half shelving, and half upon the Plain. The Plain adjoining to the
Sea, and dividing the Hill from the Bay, spreads itself into a Latitude
of three hundred Paces, but immediately widens again into a Breadth
of five hundred Paces, and so visibly enlarges itself, the farther it
extends itself into the Valleys.</p>

<p>And thus having given the Reader some Account of the Front or fore-part
of the <i>Promontory</i>, I shall now give him a short Description of the
back-side of it, which faces the Sea. Behind the second and third Hills
there are two lesser Hills, which hang over the <i>Propontis</i>. Between
these Hills descends a hollow Valley. These Hills stand in the Middle
of the Valley. That which lies Eastward, as well as that which lies to
the West, exalts itself to the Height of more than two hundred Paces.
At the End of the Valley, between these Hills, is a well built Harbour
enclosed with a Wall. ’Tis seated upon the Plain on the Shore, near
that part of the Sea which runs up to the Front of the <i>Hippodrom</i>.
The Mouth of this Harbour is three hundred Paces in Breadth. From the
Bay call’d <i>Cornu</i>, the Breadth crossing the Hill to the <i>Propontis</i>,
widens to the Distance of two Miles.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the second Valley, which divides the second from the third Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THAT Valley which divides the second from the third Hill, begins at
the <i>Promontory</i>, and ends in the Plain adjoining to the Sea. It
contains in it the Fish-Market and the Ferry, whence you cross the
Water to <i>Syca</i>. From hence to the Entrance of the Valley, a Plain
expands itself to the Breadth of four hundred Paces so much upon the
Level, that the Water falls from thence into the Bay with almost an
imperceptible Descent. When it has contracted itself into the narrow
Compass of two hundred Paces in Breadth, it gradually straightens
itself into a less, even to the Middle of the Valley, where ’tis but
fifty Paces in Breadth, and afterwards is no broader than the <i>common
Way</i>. ’Tis above six hundred Paces in Length, three hundred of which
are almost upon a Level, the other three hundred upon the Descent. It
rises easily to that part of the <i>Promontory</i>, where the second and
third Hills join. In the lowermost part of the Valley runs the <i>broad
Way</i> that faces <i>Galata</i>. This Way, on both Sides of it, is full of
Merchants Houses, cover’d with a kind of transparent Slat, which have
here and there a small Casement. The Merchants of <i>Galata</i> frequent
the grand <i>Bezestan</i>, or Place of <i>Exchange</i>. ’Tis situate partly on
the Head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> Valley, and partly on an Eminence of the third Hill.
In the Year of our Lord 1546 it was wholly burnt to the Ground, except
two <i>Basilica’s</i> roof’d with Brick-work, which were lock’d up every
Night, and their Windows secured by Iron Bars, when the Fire was over.
I was allowed after the Fire to view their grand <i>Forum</i>. I found it
lie so much upon the Level, that it had but a small Ascent either from
the West to the East, or from the South to the North. I observed that
it stood upon more than five Furlongs of Ground; on the highest part
of it, which lies to the East, I was permitted to see a <i>Nymph&aelig;um</i>,
adorn’d with five and forty Marble Pillars, which supported a Brick
Roof. The old <i>Basilica</i>, of which I could have no Prospect before, by
reason of the Shops and publick Houses, the Fire had lain open to my
View. I observed farther, that it had two additional Buildings like
Wings, joining to the main Building, each of which was divided into
sixty Apartments, which were all arched, and over the Roof cover’d
with Lead, as their Shops and Places of publick Entertainment are. The
inward Chambers of these Apartments, for Privacy, are always lock’d,
and are secured by an Iron Door. The <i>Basilica</i> itself consists of
fifteen large Apartments, in the Figure of a <i>Dome</i>, has four Doors,
and is supported by eight Pillars; the Roof is Brick-work, and leaded
at Top. The new <i>Basilica</i> is supported with twelve Pillars built of a
square Stone; four Arches bear upon these Pillars, which support twenty
small Roofs, built in the Form of a <i>Dome</i>. There stand round about
sixty Merchants Warehouses, or Shops with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span> arch’d Roofs. Within the
<i>Basilica</i> there are two hundred and twenty more of these Warehouses,
which are made after the following Manner. Round the Walls of the
<i>Basilica</i> are built abundance of very broad Pews, where the Merchants
expose their Goods to Sale, which they take out of Presses, (when they
would shew them to their Chapmen) which have Boxes of Drawers in them,
the Masters always sitting before them. These Presses are fasten’d to
the Wall, have two Folding Doors, and are removable at Pleasure.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the third Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE third Hill is bounded on each Side by two Valleys: That which
lies to the East, divides it from the second Hill, the Western Valley
divides it from the fourth. The Ridge of this Hill is above a thousand
Paces in Length. It shoots from the Top of the <i>Promontory</i> Southward,
Northward to the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, almost in an equal Height. The second
Hill on the contrary falls with a surprizing Descent, from the utmost
Height of the <i>Promontory</i>, to the lowest Plain on the Bay Shore. The
third Hill, at the Top of it is a Level of a great Length. It extends
itself at the Foot of it, more by three hundred Paces to the North,
than the Foot of the second Hill. It is not in all Places of an
equal Breadth; at the Top of the <i>Promontory</i> itself ’tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span> every way
about eight hundred Paces. Here ’tis that the <i>Seraglio</i> stands. On
that part of the Plain which lies to the East, stands the Merchants
<i>Forum</i>, a <i>Caravansera</i>, and the Sepulchre of <i>Bajazet</i> the Emperor.
On the South Side of it is an open <i>Area</i>, round which stand the
Booksellers Shops. On that part of it which lies Northward, stand the
Works which the Emperour <i>Solyman</i> is now building, namely his Tomb, a
<i>Caravansera</i>, and a magnificent and expensive Mosque. They are built
not only upon the natural Situation of the Ground there, but also upon
artificial Foundations. This Hill, on three Sides of it, descends
upon three lesser Hills. For on that Side of it which lies Eastward,
where stands the Tower of <i>Hirena</i>, a small Hill jets out into the
second Valley. The long Projecture of this Hill, on the Ridge of it
towards the Bay, makes another small Hill which lies Northward, and
from that Side of it which points Westward, where stands the Church
of St. <i>Theodore</i>, there shoots another little Hill out of the Middle
of it, to the Plain which lies on the Sea Shore. Two Sides of this
Hill descend in a double Declivity, one in a strait, and the other
in an oblique Line. The Eastern Side of the third Hill, after it has
extended itself to thirteen hundred Paces Distance, abates somewhat of
its winding Descent, but the nearer you descend to the Plain, it falls
with a more direct and confined Declivity. The Descents falling from
the Ridge of the Hill to the Valley differ very much, the uppermost
of them hanging over a very deep Valley, rise to the Height of five
hundred Paces, the lowest three hundred of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> are very steep, the
three hundred Paces above them are scarce half of that Steepness. The
other Descents of this Hill are not so shelving, where the Valley rises
higher. The Western Side of the Hill, as to its Declivities, is like
the Eastern. The Northern Side of it has several Descents: For a lesser
Hill, shooting from the Ridge of this Hill, is five hundred Paces high,
the lower most three hundred of which fall so precipitately, that
the Buildings which stand upon them, are all under-propp’d, the two
hundred Paces above them fall with an easy Descent. The Descents on
this Side of the Hill, the farther they lie from the Plain on the Sea
Shore, the more are they lengthen’d by a sideling Fall, which rises on
the Eastern Side of the Hill. The Plain on the Shore, as discontinued
by the Inlet of the Bay, is not above two hundred Paces in Breadth,
but at the Foot of the Hill, in other Parts of it, it sensibly widens
up to the Entrance of the Valleys. The <i>Grand Seraglio</i>, seated on
the Side of this Hill, when I first arrived at <i>Constantinople</i>, was
little less than six thousand Paces in Compass, but is at present more
closely straiten’d, since the <i>Caravansera’s</i> have been built there by
the Sultan <i>Solyman</i>, and the burying Place for the Women (which is
at least half the Ground) has been taken out of it and enclosed. The
left Side of the <i>Promontory</i>, which lies behind the third Hill to the
South, jets out with two lesser Hills; from one of which that shoots
Eastward, the Side of the <i>Promontory</i> which winds round Westward
to the other Hill, which is seated a little above the Foot of the
Promontory; and at the Bottom of this Hill, the <i>Promontory</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span> admits
the third Valley, which lies behind it, and from thence stretches full
North. The left Side therefore of the third Hill hath a double Descent;
the one towards the South, which is six hundred Paces high, another
extending itself South South-west, seven hundred Paces high; but at
full West it falls very short of that Height. The Plain that lies
between the back Southern Parts of the third Hill, and the Shore of the
<i>Propontis</i>, is in no part of it less than three hundred Paces broad,
nor above seven hundred Paces long. The Plain of the Valley which
encloses the Foot of the Hill Westward, and which divides the seventh
Hill from the <i>Promontory</i>, reaching from the Shore of the <i>Propontis</i>,
where the Walls are not encompassed by the Sea, is almost upon a Level,
and is in every part of it five hundred Paces in Breadth. The three
Hills I have mention’d, may very properly be called the <i>Promontory</i>
of the <i>Bosporus</i>; for they hang over the Sea in such a manner, that
whether you sail to <i>Constantinople</i> out of the <i>Black Sea</i>, or the
<i>Propontis</i>, you may see them at a great Distance, prominent over the
Chaps of the <i>Bosporus</i>. The third Valley seems to separate the other
three Hills, which lie farther into the Continent from these. The
Reason why I place six Hills in the <i>Promontory</i> of the <i>Bosporus</i> is,
because these latter Hills all stand in a Row near the Bay, and are
join’d together both at the Top and the Sides of them. The Plain which
unfolds itself on the Ridge of the third Hill, descends gently into a
Plain which hangs over the third Valley, and is six hundred and twenty
Paces in Length, and as many in Breadth.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the third Valley.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE third Valley, which lies between the third and the fourth Hill,
seems to be a double Valley; for in the Middle of it, it rises high,
which makes it doubtful whether it be a part of the Valley, or the
<i>Promontory</i>. That the Height of it is a part of the Valley, seems
plain from the Height of the Arches, which reach from one Side of the
Valley to the other; and it may be look’d upon to be the Ridge of the
<i>Promontory</i>, from the Descent of the extreme Parts of it falling to
the right and left, on each Side of the <i>Promontory</i>. On the right
Side of which, it descends into a very low Plain, which, at its first
Entrance, is three hundred Paces broad, and continues on upon a Level
to the Length of five hundred Paces more; and though it sinks at Bottom
into an equal Depth, yet the Pitches or Sides of it, in some Places,
are higher than in others. For where the Plain is most hollow, there
one of the Sides of it is three times higher than the other. From
this Plain you ascend by easy Steps to the Top of the Middle of the
Valley, which is six hundred Paces wide, except that small part of it
in the Middle, where it is not above four hundred Paces in Breadth.
Through the Top of this Valley, or <i>Promontory</i>, run the Arches of an
<i>Aqueduct</i> from the fourth to the third Hill, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> the same Height,
at the Top of them, with the Hills themselves. The Altitude of these
Arches discovers how great the Descent is from them. For though they
are alike equal in Height at the Top of them, yet this Height is very
different, according to the Difference of their Situations. For they
are very high at the Top of the Valley, which is a plain level Ground,
but upon the Descent of the Hills not near so high, and continue to the
Length of eight hundred Paces in the same Height, though the higher
they stand upon these Hills, they are less tall. The Top of this Valley
or <i>Promontory</i>, descends with a gentle Fall of seven hundred Paces
into a Plain, which divides the <i>Promontory</i> from the seventh Hill, and
from thence extends itself to the <i>Propontis</i>. The City from the Bay
to the <i>Propontis</i>, passing thro’ the third Valley, is more than ten
Furlongs in Breadth.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="Book_I_Chap_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of the fourth Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE fourth Hill is enclosed with two Valleys, the Ridge of the
<i>Promontory</i>, and the Shore of the Bay. Upon the Side of it stands the
Tomb of <i>Mahomet</i>, (who took <i>Constantinople</i>) several <i>Caravansera’s</i>
and <i>Bagnio’s</i>. It is above three thousand six hundred Paces in
Compass. The Length, from the Ridge of it to the Bay, is a thousand
Paces; the Breadth of it, from East to West, is at least eight hundred.
As you take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> View of it from the Top, stretching in a Square towards
the Bay, you perceive it to end in two Windings, though very different
from each other. For that which points Northward stretches on in a
continued Ridge, and has its Descents on both Sides, whereas that
which shoots Eastward lies so low, that it seems to be only an Ascent
to the other. At the End of it it winds Westward, where it forms a
little Valley. This Hill Eastward is bounded by a Valley, and is parted
from the third Hill; on the North by the Plain on the Shore, on the
East partly by a Valley, which divides it from the fifth Hill, and
partly by the winding of the <i>Promontory</i>, which rises in so gradual
and delectable a manner, from the Top of the fourth to the Top of the
fifth Hill, that you discover the Ridge of it to be uneven, more by
a nice Discernment of the Eye, than by any Difficulty in walking it.
For these Hills are join’d together in such a manner, that they seem
to lie upon a Level. They are both of them one Plain, which, covering
the Top of the fourth Hill, is not above four hundred Paces in Length,
nor more than two hundred in Breadth, tho’ afterwards, when continu’d
to the fifth Hill, it widens into the Breadth of five hundred Paces.
The fourth Hill, tho’ it is equal in Height to any of the other six,
yet its Ascents, whether they lie in a strait Line, or more obliquely,
are more moderate, by reason it is a long Tract of Ground with three
Declivities. The first of which, thro’ the Length of the whole,
descends from the Southwest full North more than a thousand Paces; two
hundred of which rising from the Sea Shore are a more easy Ascent, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
rest rise so very gently that you can scarce perceive them, although
the uppermost hundred of them, which reach to the Top of the Hill, are
very steep. The cross Descent which runs athwart the Breadth of the
Hill is double, one of which falls Westward; the other, which shelves
Eastward, rises from the Valley, which divides the third and fourth
Hill. From the highest part of this Valley you climb an Ascent two
hundred Paces in Height. Below the Top of it is another Ascent, which
is five hundred Paces high, one hundred of which rising from the Bottom
are very steep. The Height of the rest, which are an easy Ascent, you
discover by the Level of the <i>Aqueduct</i>. From the Bottom of the Valley
you ascend four hundred Paces, the first hundred and eighty of which
are very steep, after which you may walk two hundred more almost upon
a Level. From hence you rise to the Middle of it, which is higher,
and is a hundred Paces in Breadth. It is also elevated eight hundred
Paces in Length, from the Top of it to the Bottom. From hence you
descend two hundred Paces Westward to the lowest Part of the Valley,
which divides the fourth and the fifth Hill, which is all a narrow
Piece of Ground, and about four hundred Paces in Length. The first
two hundred Paces upon the Shore of the Bay are all upon a Level; but
it is an Uncertainty whether they are a part of the Valley, or the
Sea Shore. For this Valley is enclosed in such a manner by these two
Hills, as the fourth is bounded by the Plain upon the Shore, which is
two hundred Paces broad, whereas the fifth does scarce descend so far.
The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> eight hundred Paces are much upon the same Level, the
last four hundred of which, stretching to the Top of the <i>Promontory</i>,
are very steep. The Plain upon the Shore, passing between the Bay and
the fourth Hill, is of a different Breadth. For that part of it which
extends itself to the South-western Point of the Hill, is four hundred
Paces broad, whereas that part of it which extends itself to the
Northern Point, is no more in Breadth than two hundred Paces. In short,
such is the Situation of the fourth Hill, that when you sail along the
Bay, you would take it to be an advanced part of the third Valley.
For the Top of this Hill runs so far Southward, that its Descents,
shelving very moderately, seem almost upon a Level; whereas the Top of
the fifth Hill, which is of the same Height, projects beyond the fourth
directly Northward. The Descents on the Back of the third Hill, which
lie Southward, are very easy and agreeable, till you come to the Plain
of the Vale, which divides the <i>Promontory</i> from the seventh Hill; so
that the back part of this Hill shoots Southward, and is not bounded
on either Side of it by the third Valley. This Southern Part of it is
somewhat narrow, just beyond a little Hill of the third Valley, near
a <i>Caravansera</i>, built by the <i>Sultan Mahomet</i>; but behind the fifth
Hill, below the <i>Columna Virginea</i>, ’tis straitned much more.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Fifth Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Bottom of the fifth Hill, on the Top of which stands the Tomb of
<i>Selymus</i> the Emperor, as bounded partly by the Bay, and partly by an
Eastern and Western Valley, is four thousand Paces in Compass. The
Pitch of this Hill hangs so far over the Bay Northward, and the Pitch
of the fourth Hill lies so low towards the same Point, that the fourth
Hill seems to be a kind of Valley, situate between the third, and the
fifth Hill. For the fifth Hill does not join at Top, and continue the
Ridge of the <i>Promontory</i> as other Hills do, but being of an equal
Heighth with it, shoots to a great Distance beyond it running as far
Northward, as does the Foot of the fourth Hill. It has a Descent on
three Sides of it; one to the North, the Steepness of which the Reader
may learn from hence, that altho’ it is very near the Heighth of the
fourth Hill, which is above a thousand Paces high, yet the highest
Ascent of this Hill comes nearer upon the Line, than that of any other
Hill, to the lowest Ascent from the Bottom; for you ascend thro’ a
little Valley, no more than three hundred Paces high to the Top of it.
This Valley is form’d by two small Hills adjoining to the Shore of the
Bay, upon which, at about four hundred Paces distance, you discover
some Stone Steps, belonging to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span> Foundation of a <i>Caravansera</i>, built
by the Emperor <i>Selymus</i>. This Northern Side of the Hill has four
small Hills jetting out of it, three small Valleys running between
them, which rise from the Top of the Hill, and are situate at such a
Distance from the Plain upon the Shore, that two of them touch the Wall
which stands upon it; the other two are a hundred Paces from it. The
Plain upon the Shore is in no Part of it narrower than it is at the
Foot of this Hill; for to the Distance of a thousand Paces, it does
not exceed a hundred Paces in Breadth, and in some Places not fifty.
Two of these Hills are very steep, so that the Buildings you see upon
them, as tho’ they were in danger of falling, are all underpropp’d,
and the Inhabitants have been oblig’d to cut Windings in the Rocks to
moderate the Descent. The other two are less Precipitate, the Valleys
which enclose them not lying so deep. The Side of the Hill which shoots
Eastward is one thousand four hundred Paces in Length, and two hundred
in Breadth, and its Altitude two hundred Paces upon the Perpendicular.
The Height of the Side of it, which falls Westward, shelves into a
different Depth, according as the Valley sinks. Where it descends into
a Level Plain, it advances its Top to the Height of five hundred Paces.
In other Places it rises no higher than three hundred, with a very
moderate Ascent. The Side of the <i>Promontory</i> which points Southward,
situate behind the fifth Hill, ends in the Plain of the Valley, which
divides the <i>Promontory</i> from the seventh Hill. In other Places it
falls with a more confined, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> sometimes with a more expanded
Descent, upon a small thick Hill, which hangs over the fifth Valley;
as also over that Valley which parts the <i>Promontory</i> from the seventh
Hill. The back Part of the fifth Hill does also wind it self into a
small Valley, which rises at the Brow of the <i>Promontory</i>, where not
long since was remaining the <i>Columna Virginea</i>. From hence the Ridge
of the <i>Promontory</i> somewhat bends over the Top of the Plain of the
fifth Hill, which in some Places is six hundred, and in others seven
hundred Paces broad. But beyond the Ridge of this Hill it widens to a
great Distance, as far as the Plain of the fourth Hill, and shoots on
with the Plain of the <i>Promontory</i>, and falls down to the Neck of the
<i>Isthmus</i>, and so extending it self still on, is at least two thousand
Paces in Length.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Fifth Valley.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE fifth Valley, which divides the fifth from the sixth Hill, winding
from North to South, is as long as the <i>Promontory</i> is broad; that
is, about twelve hundred Paces; the first eight hundred of which have
no Ascent. The Valley, at the first Entrance into it, is at least
four hundred Paces broad, but is afterwards straitned into half that
Breadth; and yet to the Length of six hundred Paces, ’tis in no Place
less than two hundred Paces broad. Farther, ’tis at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span> five hundred
Paces wide. Above this, is the Top of the Valley, or the Ridge of the
<i>Promontory</i>, opening upon a Level Breadth of two hundred Paces. From
the Top of this <i>Promontory</i>, to the left Side of it, there falls a
Valley with a gentle Descent, to the Distance of five hundred Paces,
where it descends into another Valley, which divides the <i>Promontory</i>
from the seventh Hill. The fifth Valley seems to cut through the Ridge
of the <i>Promontory</i>. This may easily be discerned by the right and left
Descent of the two Hills which lie nearest to it; for there is a very
easy Ascent from the Height of this Valley, to the Top of either Hill.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="chapter" id="Book_I_Chap_XVI"><span class="smcap">Chap. XVI.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE sixth Hill is just as long as the <i>Promontory</i> is broad, which is
widen’d upon this Hill to the Breadth of two thousand four hundred
Paces. The City Walls shoot over the Ridge, and the North Side of it
down to the Sea Shore. You descend gradually from the Top of it within
the Walls; without the Walls it lies upon a Level, and is join’d to the
Continent by a Field in the Suburbs. The broadest part of it is not
above eight hundred Paces, the narrowest but four hundred. It descends
with a treble Declivity; one on the left Hand of the <i>Promontory</i>, with
an easy Descent at South-east; another on the right falling to the Bay
Northward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> which extends itself to the Distance of fifteen hundred
Paces. There are two lesser Hills, separated by a small Valley, which
run between them. At the Foot of that lesser Hill which stands nearest
to the City Wall, there is an <i>Aqueduct</i>. Between this Hill and the
Bay, there formerly stood the Church of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, which has
been recorded in the Writings of many Historians. The Foundation of
this Church was remaining, when I first arrived at <i>Constantinople</i>.
From the Foot of this Hill, which stands above the Church I have
mention’d, there rises a Spring, whose Waters are convey’d thro’ arch’d
subterraneous Passages into the City, where, appearing above Ground,
they flow constantly into a Marble Cistern. That Side of the sixth Hill
which lies Eastward, is as long as the Hill itself; but does not, in
all parts of it, fall with the same Descent. For the Descent varies,
according as the Valley adjoining lies higher or lower. Where the
Valley lies upon the Level, the Pitch of the Hill rises to the Height
of six hundred Paces; where it does not lie so low, ’tis not above five
hundred Paces high; where it rises higher, not above four hundred. Nor
does this Side of the Hill shoot only Eastward, but does also, on the
right Side of it, project Northward, and on the left Side of it extend
itself full South-west. The Plain on the Shore, which lies between the
Foot of the Hill and the Bay, in the narrow part of it, is not above
eight hundred Paces broad, I mean in that Place where the Church of the
<i>Blachern&aelig;</i> stood formerly, as did also a <i>Triclinium</i>; but farther on
it winds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> round into the third Valley, and widens much more.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Valley which divides the seventh from the six Hills of the
<i>Promontory</i>, is an easy Descent. It extends itself in Length to the
Distance of four thousand Paces, if you take in the Plain on the Sea
Shore. If you exclude that, and take your Dimensions from the winding
of the seventh Hill, ’tis not above three thousand three hundred
Paces long. It lies so much upon a Level, that you cannot perceive by
walking it, that it has the least Ascent; yet you may discover by the
Discernment of the Eye that it sensibly lengthens and widens itself
into a greater Breadth. It bounds the Sides of the third and the fifth
Valley, and the lowest Eminences of the fifth and sixth Hills. It is
full of Gardens and pleasant Meadows. Here the Soldiers sometimes act
their Mock-Fights. There’s a Rivulet which runs through the Middle of
it, which is often dry in Summer Time.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the seventh Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE seventh Hill is called the <i>Xerolophos</i>, on which stands the Pillar
of <i>Arcadius</i>. This Hill is little less than twelve thousand Paces in
Circumference, and contains more than a third Part of the City. The
other two Parts are comprehended in the Compass of the <i>Promontory</i>,
which is above twenty thousand Paces in Circumference. By <i>Paces</i>, I
would here be thought to mean the ordinary Steps we take in Walking,
which I cannot exactly reduce to a just Mensuration with the <i>Roman
Pace</i>, by reason of the Turnings and Windings of the Ways, and the
Differences of Paces, which are longer or shorter, according to the
different Ascents and Descents of the Ground we walk. This Hill makes
the third Angle of the City, from whence <i>Constantinople</i> is look’d
upon to be of a triangular Figure. It lies shelving with a very
moderate Descent, and has a double Declivity; one of which falls gently
into the Valley, which divides the seventh Hill from the <i>Promontory</i>,
and is of an equal Length with the Valley itself. The other Descent,
which partly lies to the South-east, and partly to the South, falls
into the <i>Propontis</i>, and is in some Places five hundred Paces steep,
in others four hundred, three hundred, a hundred, nay even fifty,
till it comes to the Point of the third Angle of the City, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> a
large Plain shoots out towards the Sea, which, in different Places,
is of a different Breadth. The Entrance of this Plain, at the Angle
of the City just mention’d, is very narrow; it afterwards widens,
which is occasioned by the Winding of one of its Sides, from whence
it gently rises to the Foot of a small Hill, where ’tis four hundred
Paces broad; onwards it is straiten’d into fifty, and afterwards is
widen’d into a Breadth of a hundred Paces only. The End of this Plain,
to the Distance of a thousand Paces, is more than four hundred Paces
broad. On the Ridge of this Hill, there is a Plain of some Length and
Breadth; the Hill itself is bounded by the Land Wall, and on the Top of
it is a Cistern which is call’d <i>Mocisia</i>, which is wholly unroof’d,
and stripp’d of its Pillars. This Cistern is nine hundred and seventy
Paces in Circumference. The Walls of it, which are made of squared
Free-stone, are still remaining; and the Ground where it stands, is now
turn’d into a Garden.</p>

<p>Thus is it that I have laid before the Reader a <i>Plan</i> or <i>Description</i>
of the Situation of the City of <i>Constantinople</i>, by which means the
Situation of the <i>Wards</i> of that City will be more easily discovered.
I hope I shall not be thought to have dwelt too long on this Subject,
since a verbal Delineation of it is the most concise way of coming to
the Knowledge of it. For although <i>Constantinople</i>, by reason of the
Eminency of its Situation, affords a most agreeable Prospect at the
remotest Distance, yet thus to particularize the several Parts of the
City, leads the Reader into a more exact and more expeditious Insight
into it, than any other Method of Information whatsoever.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Walls of the City.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Walls of <i>Constantinople</i>, in some Places, are built with squared
Free-stone, in others with rough Stone, and in many Places with an
Intermixture of Brick and Stone together. The Walls on the Land Side
are double, secured with a large Ditch five and twenty Paces broad. One
of the Walls is carry’d somewhat farther than the Length of the Ditch,
and is very strongly fortified. These Walls stand at eighteen Foot
Distance from each other. The inward Wall is very lofty, and more than
twenty Foot in Thickness, upon which are built two hundred and fifty
Towers with Steps, facing the Continent. The outward Wall is not above
half as big, but has the same Number of Towers. As to the Nature of its
Fortification, the Ground that takes up the Distance between the Ditch
and the outward Wall, is higher than the adjoining Side of the Ditch,
and the Ground between the two Walls is higher than that. The Countrey
opening without the Walls is not incumber’d with Buildings, and is
partly hilly, and partly upon the Level, but chiefly upon the latter,
so that you have a delightful Prospect over the Fields before you, and
a very extensive View all about you: And there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> Doubt to be made,
but that <i>Constantinople</i> might be made a terrible strong Place. The
Walls which run round the Sea, are not so high as the Land Walls; they
are a plain Building, but very thick, and well guarded with Towers. On
the Side of the Bay <i>Ceras</i>, they are about fifty Paces distant from
the Shore. On the Side of the <i>Bosporus</i> and the <i>Propontis</i>, they are
built upon the Shore, except where they are discontinu’d by some Port
or Landing-place. <i>Zonaras</i> relates, that <i>Theophilus</i> the Emperor
not only repaired, but raised these Walls higher, after they had been
much impair’d by Time, and the Dashings of the Sea. This is also
confirm’d to us down even to the present Age; for in many Places of
them, I observ’d the Name of <i>Theophilus</i> the Emperor was cut in very
large Characters. The Emperor <i>Nicephorus</i> was hated by his People for
levying a Tax upon them, which was call’d <i>Diceraton</i>, for repairing
these Walls. I learn from the <i>Constitutions</i> of <i>Justinian</i>, that in
his Time the Walls were commonly call’d the <i>old</i> and the <i>new</i> Walls,
where he decrees, <i>That a larger Fee shall be paid the Bearers, and
those who attend a Corpse beyond the</i> new <i>Walls of the City</i>. What I
would observe from hence is, that the old Walls which were built by
<i>Constantine</i>, and that the new Walls which were built by <i>Theodosius
the Less</i>, were both standing in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>. The Walls
of old <i>Byzantium</i> I have described in the Beginning of this Book; and
as to the Condition they were in formerly, we may learn more fully
from <i>Herodian</i>, who writes, that <i>Byzantium</i> was inclosed with a very
large and a very strong Wall, made of square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span> Stones of a great Size,
so artfully cemented, that it was look’d upon as one compacted Piece
of Work. This is also confirm’d by the Authority of <i>Pausanias</i>, who
tells us, <i>That he never saw the Walls of</i> Babylon, <i>or of</i> Memnon,
<i>nor ever heard of any Person who had seen them: But the Walls of</i>
Byzantium <i>and</i> Rhodes, says he, <i>are accounted exceeding strong; and
yet the Walls which inclose</i> Messene <i>are stronger than these</i>. ’Tis
recorded by some Historians, that the <i>Athenians</i> kept their Treasury
at <i>Byzantium</i>, because it was a well fortify’d Place. Whether those
Walls which the Author of the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i> calls
the double Walls are the same which we see at <i>Constantinople</i> at
present, or whether they were built by <i>Theodosius</i>, I leave it to the
Judgment of the Reader. Thus far I shall give my Opinion, <i>viz.</i> That
they do not seem to me to be entirely the same Walls which that Author
describes. For he places the Church of the <i>Apostles</i> in a <i>Ward</i>
which is near to the Walls of the City, and places the fourteenth
<i>Ward</i> without the Walls of the City, which at present, if not all of
it, at least the best part of it, is within the Walls. I would add,
that <i>Theodosius the Less</i>, who reign’d before <i>Justinian</i>, does not
place the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i> within the Walls of the City, and yet I have
the Authority of <i>Procopius</i>, that these were apart of the Suburbs in
the Time of <i>Justinian</i>, tho’ at present they are enclosed within the
Walls, as were also the seven Towers, and the Church which was built by
<i>Stadius</i>, (or rather <i>Studius</i>) who was afterwards <i>Consul</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Gates of</i> Constantinople, <i>and the seven Towers of Old</i>
Byzantium.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Walls on the Side of the Continent have six Gates; one within the
Palace of <i>Constantine</i>, another, which is call’d the <i>Adrianopolitan</i>
Gate, and a third on the Brow of the seventh Hill. Besides these,
there is the <i>Porta Aurea</i> or <i>Gilded Gate</i>, the Gate of <i>Selymbria</i>
or <i>Rhegium</i>, and the Gate of the seven Towers. On the Side of the Bay
<i>Ceras</i> is the Gate of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, at present call’d <i>Xyloporta</i>,
seated near the third Angle of the City. There are also the Gates
call’d <i>Cynigos</i>, or <i>Porta Palatina</i>, <i>Phanaria</i>, <i>Agia</i>, <i>Porta
Jubalica</i>, <i>Farinaria</i>, <i>Lignaria</i>, <i>Seminaria</i>, <i>Piscaria</i>, the Gate
of the <i>Neorium</i>, and the Gate of <i>Demetrius</i>, which stands on the
Ridge of the first Hill. On the Side of the <i>Propontis</i> there are
about five; every one of which has <i>Stairs</i>, or a <i>Landing-place</i>,
and a Haven for Ships, besides the Gates of the Imperial Palace.
There is also the <i>Porta Stercoraria</i>, <i>Leonina</i>, <i>Condescala</i>, two
of which stand at the Foot of the seventh Hill. Those which have been
principally taken Notice of by Historians, are the Gates of <i>Cynigos</i>,
<i>Rhegium</i> and <i>Xylocerum</i>, also the Gate of <i>Eugenius</i>, the <i>Porta
Aurea</i>, that call’d <i>Myriandros</i>, the <i>Porta Condescala</i>, and <i>Porta
Carsiana</i>. In old <i>Byzantium</i> there was the <i>Thracian Gate</i>. For we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
are told by <i>Dion</i>, that the seven Towers reach’d from the <i>Thracian</i>
Gate to the Sea, which <i>Cedrinus</i> tells us was the Bay <i>Ceras</i>. If
any one spoke any thing in the first of these Towers, it immediately
flew to the second, and so through all the rest, so that you might
hear the Voice distinctly repeated in every one of them. <i>Pliny</i> tells
the very same Story of <i>Cyzicus</i>. In that City, says he, near the
<i>Thracian</i> Gate there are seven Towers, which multiply the Voice by
Repetition, or Reiteration, more than seven times. This, he adds, was
look’d upon by the <i>Grecians</i> as somewhat miraculous, and was call’d
the <i>Echo</i>. I never found any Mention made of the <i>Thracian</i> Gates in
any Historian but in <i>Pliny</i>, though it is not altogether improbable,
that there were such Gates there; for <i>Apollonius</i>, in the <i>first Book</i>
of his <i>Argonauticks</i>, mentions the <i>Thracian</i> Haven in <i>Cyzicus</i>; and
<i>Plutarch</i> is very express, that near this City there was a Street
call’d the <i>Thracian Street</i>. This is also attested not only by some
more modern Writers of <i>Constantinople</i>, but also by <i>Dion</i> and
<i>Xenophon</i>; the latter of whom writes, That when <i>Alcibiades</i> appear’d
before the Town, the <i>Byzantians</i> open’d the <i>Thracian</i> Gates to him of
their own Accord.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the long Walls.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Suburbs and Fields adjoining were inclosed with Walls of such an
immoderate Length, that they extended themselves from the City to the
Distance of a two Days Journey. They were built by <i>Anastasius</i> the
Emperor to prevent the Incursions of the <i>Scythians</i> and <i>Bulgarians</i>,
reach’d from the <i>Black Sea</i> to the <i>Propontis</i>, were forty thousand
Paces remote from the City, and twenty <i>Roman</i> Foot in Breadth. These
Walls were often taken and batter’d by the barbarous Nations, but
repair’d by <i>Justinian</i>; and that the Soldiers garrisoned there might
defend them to the best Advantage, he order’d the Passages of one Tower
to another to be stopp’d up, no Entrance being allow’d, but the Door
at the Bottom of the Steps, by which it was ascended; so that by this
means it was sufficiently guarded, though the Enemies Forces were in
the Heart of the City. <i>Evagrius</i> the sacred Historian tells us, that
<i>Anastasius</i> built the long Wall, which was two hundred and eighty
Furlongs distant from the City, that it reach’d from Sea to Sea, was
four hundred Furlongs in Length, that it was a good Security to those
who sail’d out of the <i>Black Sea</i> to the <i>Propontis</i>, and that it put a
Stop to the Excursions of the barbarous Nations.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">Having</span> describ’d the Figure and Extent of the City, and having
particularized the Situation of the <i>seven Hills</i>, I shall proceed
to consider what Buildings and Monuments <i>Constantinople</i> anciently
had, or now has, and into how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span> <i>Wards</i> it was divided. For when
I accidentally fell upon this Division of the City into <i>Wards</i>, in
an ancient <i>Manuscript</i> written above one thousand Years ago, by a
Gentleman more noble by his Birth than his Writings, I was in hopes,
with some Ease, to have traced out the ancient City; but the barbarous
<i>Mahometans</i> have either so demolish’d those venerable and truly
heroick Ornaments which distinguish’d it, to adorn their own paultry
Houses, or entirely buried them in their own Ruins, that in very few
Places you shall see any Remains of an old Foundation. I omit to
mention the Fires and other Devastations, committed not only by the
Savages of other Countries, but the great Havock lately made by the
<i>Turks</i> themselves, who for the last hundred Years have incessantly
endeavour’d entirely to deface and destroy it, by building upon it in
so different a Manner, that those who have formerly seen some parts of
it, scarce know its ancient Situation. Consider farther the profound
Ignorance of the <i>Greeks</i> at present. There is scarce a Man of them who
either knows, or has so much as an Inclination to know, where their
<i>Antiquities</i> are. Nay, their Priests are so heedless and negligent
in this Respect, that they will not make the least Enquiry themselves
about those Places, where but a few Years since very magnificent
Temples were standing, and so very censorious are they, as to condemn
those that do. However, that I might not pass away my Time uselessly,
while I was in Expectation of Remittances from my Royal Master, for
purchasing all the ancient <i>Manuscripts</i> I could meet with, I made it
my Business, by all the Marks of Antiquity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> I was capable of observing,
to make what Discoveries I could. In my Description of the ancient
Monuments, I shall observe the same Method I did in the Description of
the Hills. I shall consider them in the Order the Hills stand, or as I
find them in the different <i>Wards</i> of the City; which, like <i>Old Rome</i>,
was divided into fourteen <i>Wards</i>.</p>

<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Ancient Monuments of the first</i>
Hill, <i>and of the first</i> Ward <i>of the City</i>.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE first Hill, which <i>Pliny</i> sometimes calls <i>Chrysoceras</i>, and
sometimes <i>Auri Cornu</i>, (though this was a Mistake, as appears from
what I have wrote concerning the <i>Thracian Bosporus</i>) <i>Dionysius</i>
a <i>Byzantian</i> calls the <i>Promontory</i> of the <i>Bosporus</i>. <i>There are
two Reasons assigned</i>, says he, <i>why ’tis call’d the</i> Promontory <i>of
the</i> Bosporus; <i>the one is, as some say, because a Cow stung with
a Gad-Bee forded over it. Others more fabulously report, that</i> Io,
<i>the Daughter of</i> Inachus, <i>being changed into a Cow, swam across
it, when she went into</i> Asia. The same Author, speaking of a Place
call’d <i>Semystra</i>, tells us, that <i>Byzantium</i> had been founded there,
had not a Raven snatched a Part of the Sacrifice, they offer’d upon
their landing, out of the Fire, and carry’d it to the <i>Promontory</i>
of the <i>Bosporus</i>. This they look’d upon as a Token from the Gods,
that they should found their City there. The same Writer, speaking in
another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span> Place of a <i>Promontory</i> call’d <i>Metopum</i>, opposite to the
first Hill of <i>Constantinople</i>, this <i>Promontory</i>, he adds, faces the
City, and lies directly against the <i>Promontory</i> of the <i>Bosporus</i>;
and the same Author informs us, that a little above the <i>Promontory</i>
of the <i>Bosporus</i>, there was an Altar erected to <i>Minerva</i>, who was
call’d <i>Ecbasia</i>, or <i>Egressoria</i>, because those who transplanted the
Colony hither, sally’d out from thence, with a Bravery equal to those,
who fight for their Countrey. We might also call her <i>Ecbateria</i>,
under which Name, as <i>Hesychius</i> reports, <i>Diana</i> was worshipped in
<i>Siphnus</i>. He adds farther, that upon the same <i>Promontory</i> stood
the old Temple of <i>Neptune</i>, and below it, upon the Plain, that the
<i>Byzantian</i> Youth exercised themselves in Horse-racing, driving the
Chariot, Wrestling, and other Martial Sports; and lastly, that at the
Foot of the <i>Promontory</i> stood a Bay call’d <i>Ceras</i>, which had three
Havens, fortify’d with three Cittadels, and high Sand-banks, upon it
stood the Castle of <i>Byzantium</i>, of which <i>Xenophon</i> takes Notice,
when he tells us, that the Men under his Command, having forc’d their
Way into the Town, the Inhabitants fearing they should be put to the
Sword if their City was taken, some fled to the adjoining <i>Promontory</i>,
others to the Sea, and that some of them steering about a long time in
a Fisher-boat, made at last a landing, got into a Tower, from thence
made Signals of Distress, and were assisted at last by the People of
<i>Chalcedon</i>. And not only the Castle of old <i>Byzantium</i> was built
upon the first Hill, but Historians assure us, that the Emperours of
<i>Constantinople</i> likewise continu’d a Fortress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> there, when they tell
us, that to keep off the Enemy from entring the Port, they laid a Boom
across the River, from the Cittadel to the Castle of <i>Galata</i>: Nay,
even at this Day, the <i>Grand Seignor</i> has a Cittadel there, fortify’d
with thick Walls, which enclose his spacious Gardens on all sides. In
old <i>Byzantium</i> there was a Place call’d the <i>Thracian</i> Field, lying
upon a Level, and not incumber’d with Houses. It was upon this Plain
that <i>Xenophon</i> drew up in Military Order the <i>Grecian</i> Army. He
informs us, in his Book of his <i>Hellenici</i>, that this Field was near
the <i>Thracian</i> Gate; they open’d, says he, the Gates adjoining the
<i>Thracian</i> Field: And in the 7ᵗʰ Book of the <i>Expedition of Cyrus</i>,
speaking of a Place, seated near the Walls of <i>Byzantium</i>, where
he ranged his Army in order of Battle, he tells us, that the most
convenient Place to draw up, or muster an Army is, the <i>Thracian</i>
Field; because, as he goes on, ’tis free of Houses, and upon a Plain.
I observ’d before, that the seven Towers of <i>Byzantium</i> reach’d from
the <i>Thracian</i> Gate to the Sea; <i>Georgius Cedrinus</i> asserts, that
they reach’d to the Northern-Sea, that is, to the Bay call’d <i>Ceras</i>.
<i>Herodotus</i> attests, that in old <i>Byzantium</i> stood an Altar erected
to <i>Diana Orthosia</i>, and a Temple dedicated to <i>Bacchus</i>. <i>Darius</i>,
says he, <i>upon viewing the Black Sea, came back to the Bridge, and
erected upon the</i> Bosporus <i>two Stone Columns, on which he order’d to
be engraven the</i> Assyrian <i>and</i> Greek <i>Alphabets. The</i> Byzantians
<i>afterwards removed them into the City, near to the Altar of</i> Diana
Orthosia. <i>The</i> Greek <i>Alphabet was what they retain’d, and made use
of. The Column with the</i> Assyrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> <i>Characters they left remaining
near the Temple of</i> Bacchus, <i>where they had fix’d it</i>. <i>Laurentius</i>
translates the <i>Greek</i> Word <i>Orthosia</i>, <i>Erecta</i>, but he had translated
it more properly, had he call’d her <i>Erectoria</i>, or <i>Erectrix</i>, because
as being the Goddess of Child-birth she <i>raises up</i>, or <i>recovers</i>
Women in Labour. This I collect to be the true Sense of the Word,
not only from several Authors, but from <i>Plutarch</i>, who in his Book
of <i>Rivers</i>, has this Story: <i>Proud</i> Teuthras, <i>King of</i> Mysia, says
he, <i>with his Retinue of Spearmen chas’d a Boar, which fled into the
Temple of</i> Diana Orthosia <i>to implore her Assistance. As they were
all driving furiously into the Temple, the Boar cry’d out with an
audible human Voice</i>, Let your Compassion, Royal Sir, be shewn to
one whom <i>Diana</i> brought into the World. Teuthras <i>enraged at this,
slew the Creature</i>. Diana <i>resenting the Affront, threw the King into
a Phrenzy, and punished him with ulcerous Sores. He could not bear
the Indignity of his Punishment, and so retired to the Mountains.
His Mother</i> Lysippa, <i>immediately, with the Prophet</i> Polyidius, <i>who
inform’d her of the Occasion of her Son’s Sufferings, hastens in Search
of him, and by sacrificing to</i> Diana <i>some Oxen, reconciles her to
him. When she perceiv’d her Son return’d to his Senses, she erected an
Altar to</i> Diana Orthosia, <i>and near it placed a Golden Boar, with a
Man’s Head upon his Shoulders</i>. Before the Destruction of <i>Byzantium</i>
by <i>Severus</i>, both the Altar and the Boar were standing, in the first
Valley of the first Hill. Since <i>Constantine</i> rebuilt the City, the
first Hill included in it the first <i>Ward</i>, which contain’d the House
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> <i>Placidia Augusta</i>, that also of the most noble <i>Marina</i>, and
the Baths of <i>Arcadius</i>. I learn this from the ancient Division of
the City into <i>Wards</i>, though I must confess myself at a Loss, to
know in what Part of the City the first <i>Ward</i> began, nor can I make
any such Discovery from the Remains of any ancient Buildings, which
are now entirely destroy’d. However, thus much may be inferr’d from
<i>Procopius</i>, who has it upon Record, that when you sail from the
<i>Propontis</i> to the Eastern Part of the City, there stand the publick
Baths, built by <i>Arcadius</i>. In this Place, says he, <i>Justinian</i> built a
Court, which was encompassed with so calm a Sea, that when you walk’d
in the Galleries, you might discourse audibly with the Sailors. It made
a very beautiful, a very delightful, and most magnificent Prospect:
It was fann’d with gentle Breezes, supported with lofty Columns, and
laid with the most curious Marble, which like the Sun, reflected a
most amazing Lustre: It was also adorn’d with abundance of Marble and
brazen Statues, finish’d to the nicest Perfection; a lovely Scene to
the Spectators! The Reader, had he seen it, would have taken it to
have been the Work of <i>Phidias</i>, <i>Lysippus</i>, or <i>Praxiteles</i>. Upon a
high Pillar of <i>Porphyry</i> Marble, in the same Place, stood the Statue
of the Empress <i>Theodora</i>, addressing herself, as it were, to him for
building so noble a Structure. The Beauty of the Column is exceedingly
surprising, yet does it by no means come up to that inconceivable
inexpressible Gracefulness and Dignity you see in the Statue. From
these Words of <i>Procopius</i>, as I would observe by the By, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> that
Pillar now landing upon a Descent, lying Eastward of the <i>Grand
Seignor</i>’s Palace, is not the same with that upon which <i>Theodora</i>
was erected, as some are of Opinion it is; because it is neither of a
<i>Porphyry</i> Colour, and is at too remote a Distance form the Court; so
would I have the Reader understand, that the first <i>Ward</i> contain’d in
it the Length of the first Hill, which is bounded on three Sides by the
Sea. I find not only in many <i>Historians</i>, but also in <i>Suidas</i> the
<i>Grammarian</i>, that the Statue of <i>Arcadia</i>, the second Wife of <i>Zeno</i>,
stood in the <i>Arcadian</i> Baths, near the Places call’d the <i>Bathra</i>,
from the Stairs by which you ascend them. I find also in that Place two
Statues of <i>Verina</i>, the Wife of <i>Leo Magnus</i>, one in the Northern Part
of the City, near the Church of St. <i>Agathonicus</i> beyond the <i>Bathra</i>,
the other on that Side of the City where stands the Church of St.
<i>Barbara</i>: The first was erected by <i>Leo</i> in his Life-time, the second
since his Death; when upon the Flight of <i>Zeno</i>, his Son in Law, his
Brother <i>Basiliscus</i> was crown’d Emperor in his stead. I have reason
to believe, when I consider the natural Situation and Order in which
the <i>Wards</i> stand, that Part of the second <i>Ward</i> was inclos’d in the
Palace: For this <i>Ward</i>, according to the ancient Description of it,
at its first Entrance stood upon a Level; at some Distance it rose by
a gentle Ascent, and at last, with very deep Precipices, fell into the
Sea. I am of Opinion, that these Precipices descended on that Spot
of Ground where the Kitchens, and <i>Bagnio’s</i> of the <i>Grand Seignor</i>
stand at present. But where-ever they might stand in ancient Times,
all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> steep Places that were formerly enclosed within the <i>Palace</i>
are now levell’d, where now there stands an old Church commonly call’d
<i>Sophia the Less</i>. Some of the most ancient Inhabitants affirm it to
be the Church of St. <i>Irene</i>, which <i>Socrates</i> tells us was built by
<i>Constantine the Great</i>. I take it to be the same Church which the
People of the second <i>Ward</i> call the <i>Old Church</i>. I have Reason also
to believe, that the other Part of the second <i>Ward</i> stood without
the <i>Palace</i>, from the Situation of the <i>Churches</i> and <i>Bagnio’s</i>,
which the second <i>Ward</i> encloses. For <i>Zonaras</i> and other Historians
assert, that the Church, which formerly went by the Name of the <i>Great
Church</i>, was afterwards call’d the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, which every
body knows stood without the Enclosure of the Palace. I have reason to
conjecture also, that the Palace of <i>Maximinus</i> formerly stood within

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Church of St.</i> Sophia.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE modern Writers among the <i>Greeks</i> will have it, that the Church of
St. <i>Sophia</i> was first built by the Emperor <i>Constantius</i>, the Son of
<i>Constantine the Great</i>, and arch’d at Top, not with Brick-work, but
a wooden Roof. In the Time of <i>Theodosius</i>, when the second <i>Synod</i>
was held there, the <i>Arians</i> rising in Sedition, burnt it. It was
after rebuilt by <i>Theodosius the Great</i>, and beautified with Arches
of a cylindrick Form. The same <i>Writer</i> tells us, that it was burnt
a second time in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>; but <i>Sozomen</i>, an ancient
and creditable Author, records it, that in the Time of <i>Theodosius
the Less</i>, when there were warm Debates in the <i>great Church</i>, about
expelling St. <i>Chrysostom</i> the <i>Synod</i>, it was all on a sudden in
a Blaze, those who adhered to him throwing Fire into it, with an
Intention to burn down the Church, and to destroy all that were in
it. <i>Procopius</i> will have it, that it was first burnt down in the
Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, who rebuilt it in the same Figure it stands at
present; but he does not tell us, whether it stands on the same Spot
of Ground or not; so that it remains doubtful from this Author, who
is not so much to be depended upon, though he has a Catalogue of the
Names of the Persons of whom <i>Justinian</i> purchas’d the Houses where it
stood before the Fire. An <i>Ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span> Description of the City</i>, wrote
before <i>Justinian</i>’s Time, seems to fix it in another Place; for the
<i>great Church</i> and the <i>old Church</i>, the Author places in the second
<i>Ward</i>, the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Augustus</i> in the fourth, which I shall make
appear stood near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> says, that
<i>Justinian</i> built it much larger from the old Foundation; but ’tis
much to be question’d, whether <i>Justinian</i> purchas’d the neighbouring
Houses for its Enlargement. As to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Augustus</i>, and the
<i>great Church’s</i> being placed in different <i>Wards</i>, we cannot from
hence conclude, that they did not stand near one another. So that when
<i>Justinian</i> had enlarged and beautify’d it, and adorned it with a great
Variety of Metal-work, when he had built the Walls and Roof with Brick,
and to strengthen them the more, had cramp’d them in many Places with
Iron-work, using no Rafters in the whole Fabrick for fear of Fire;
although it has hitherto escaped the Flames, yet has it been often
damaged and endanger’d by several Accidents, even from the Time of its
Rebuilding. For the Eastern Arch before it was finish’d, bore with its
Weight so hard upon the Pillars, that in all Probability it had fell,
had not the Architect been very expeditious in finishing it; when
bearing upon its own <i>Curvature</i>, it laid less heavy upon the Pillars
which supported it. The two Northern and Southern <i>Arches</i> bore so hard
upon the Pillars and Foundation, that the Tops of the <i>Pillars</i> began
to fly; and had sunk, if the Workmen had not with the greatest Skill
taken them down, and afterwards replaced them, when the Greenness and
Moisture of the Building was somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> abated. The Church however, at
the Emperor’s great Expence, and by the indefatigable Industry of the
Workmen, was at last finish’d; yet in his own Time it was grievously
shock’d by an Earthquake, by which, as <i>Agathius</i> writes, the Tower
above the Roof was much shatter’d in the Middle of it; so that the
Emperor was obliged to repair and strengthen it, raising it much
higher than it was before. This was done when <i>Anthemius</i> the first
Architect was dead. However young <i>Isidorus</i>, and some other Architects
who succeeded him, notwithstanding the Errors committed in the former
Building, did not judge it necessary to take down the Eastern or
Western Arches, but widen’d the North and South Arches, and so visibly
enlarged them, that the whole Building seem’d more regular and uniform;
so that it was evident to the Eye of the Spectator, that the Sides of
the Church, which terminated with their Arches in the Roof, were of
an equal Dimension; and that the Architects had with so much Skill
contracted the vast Vacuity of the Body of the Church into so narrow a
Compass at the Top, that the whole Structure seem’d very proportionate
and agreeable. Above the Arches, in the Middle of the Church, they
raised a <i>Dome</i> or <i>Cupola</i> to a very great Height, which was regular,
and not so round at Top as usual, but more spiked, and better contrived
for the Security of the Building. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, That the <i>great
Church</i> being finished and consecrated; it happen’d that the Eastern
Arch was thrown down by an Earthquake, which broke the Pulpit and the
Communion-Table, but was afterwards rebuilt by <i>Justinian</i>, who raised
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span> twenty five Foot higher than it was before. The same Report, almost
Word for Word, is given by <i>Cedrinus</i>. He also built other Pillars
proportionable to the Weight of the Arch which bore upon them. On
the Outside of the Church he built a Pair of Winding-steps against
the Pillars, near to the Church, which rising from the Ground to the
Roof of it, support the Pillars, and the Arches. Other Writers, but
of less Note, will have it, that by the Earth-quake above-mention’d
the Roof of the Church was thrown down, but that the Arches stood
secure, that the Emperor rebuilt the Roof, but lower than before by
twenty five Foot. I could, for my own part, bear with this Relation, if
these Historians would agree with me, that the Church was afterwards
shock’d with other Earth-quakes, and then built lower than it stood
before. For when <i>Evagrius</i> tells us that <i>Justinian</i> raised it to
such an Height, that within side of it you could scarce see the Top,
and that the Descent was so deep, that it was dangerous to look from
the Height of it downwards, it is very probable, that <i>Justinian</i> only
raised it to its former Height. <i>Cedrinus</i> relates, that <i>Basilius</i>
the Emperor gave Orders for repairing, and strengthening the great
Western Arch, which was very much shatter’d by an Earth-quake, and
likely to fall. <i>Nicephorus</i> inveighs bitterly against the Empress
<i>Anna</i>, who in the Reign of <i>Catacosmus</i>, sacrilegiously robb’d the
Church of all its Furniture and Ornaments, and exclaims heavily, that
the Tyranny, Oppression, and the different Sects and Opinions of those
Times, were the chief Occasion of the Destruction of this Church: For,
as he subjoins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span> one Midnight when the Sky was very clear, one of the
Eastern Arches fell to the Ground, and brought that Part of the Roof,
which it supported, after it, which broke down the Pulpit, the Images
which adorn’d it, and demolished the middle Galleries. He adds farther,
that it was the Opinion of many in those Times, that if <i>Andronicus</i>
the Emperor had not built Buttresses on the East-side of the Church,
it had wholly sunk into Ruines. <i>Evagrius</i> determines the Length of
the Church in the following manner: From the Arch, where the bloodless
Sacrifice is offer’d, to the Gate opposite to it, it is an hundred
and ninety Foot long; from North to South it is a hundred and fifteen
Foot broad; and from the Pavement to the Center of the Roof, it is a
hundred and eighty Foot high. It was dangerous for me to measure its
Length from East to West, so that I was obliged to have the Dimensions
of it taken for me by a <i>Turk</i>, who made his Report, that the Church
was two hundred and thirteen Foot in Breadth, two hundred and forty in
Length, and from the Pavement to the highest Curvature of the Arches,
a hundred and forty two Foot in Height. The Fellow never measured the
Roof; If he had taken the Height of it true, he had found but a small
Difference between his own Account and that of <i>Evagrius</i>. Should the
Reader desire to be inform’d more at large of the Dimensions, and the
Architecture of this Church, as it stood in former Times, let him
consult <i>Procopius</i>, <i>Agathius</i>, <i>Paulus Florus</i>, and <i>Evagrius</i>. What
the Architecture and Dimensions of it are at present, I shall, as far
as my Observations have reach’d, describe more fully in the following
Chapter.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>A Description of the Church of St.</i> Sophia,
<i>as it now appears</i>.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Walls and Roof of this Church are built with Brick. The Inside of
the Walls of the Church are incrusted with elegant Marble of several
Kinds. All its Materials are the most valuable Productions of Nature,
so that the Prospect of it employs the Thoughts of the Spectator with
Delight and Admiration. The Roof of it is a surprizing Piece of gilded
<i>Mosaick</i> Work, which reflects such a Lustre upon the Eye, that even
the <i>Barbarians</i> who behold it, are wonderfully taken with the Sight
of it. This Roof is supported with eight Pillars, four of the largest
and tallest of which bear up the four Arches which support the Roof.
Two of these Arches, <i>viz.</i> the Northern and Southern, bear at the
Bottom of their Curvature upon a thin Wall full of Windows, which Wall
is strengthen’d by two Ranges of Pillars standing one above another.
In the lower Range stand eight Pillars, which rise from the Pavement,
the six above them support the thin Wall. The Eastern and Western
Arches have neither a Wall nor a Pillar to support them, but are so
open, that they make the Body of the Church appear more large. For
these Arches projecting beyond the former, bear upon four other Arches,
which are supported by two small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> and two large Pillars: For the four
large Pillars do not only bear up the four great Arches, but every
one of them does also support two small Arches, one of which extends
itself length-ways, the other cross-ways of the Church; by which
means the Church is lengthen’d and widen’d to a great Distance; for
on the East and West Side of it there are two <i>Semi-domes</i> which are
join’d to the <i>Cupola</i> in such a Manner, that they have the same Roof
within the Church, though without it the Roofs seem to be distinct.
These <i>Semi-domes</i> are a great Ornament to the <i>Cupola</i>, which rises
very highly above them. The Breadth of the Church is widen’d beyond
the <i>Dome</i> with Arches and Pillars, and the Northern and Southern
Wall, which form the three upper and three lower Galleries, which are
incrusted with elegant Marble of different Kinds, the Roof of them
being cover’d with <i>Moresco Mosaick</i> Work, finely gilded. Every Arch
which lies across the Church bears only upon one Pillar, for one End
of their Curvatures is supported by the outward Wall of the Church,
which bears upon large Pillars, from whence there rise four Arches,
which on both Sides of the Church are supported by the Wall. Two of
these Arches bear up the Roof of the three lower Galleries, and the
other two support the Roof of the three upper Galleries, the Sides of
which bear upon Walls, and Arches, and Pillars. Hence it is, that if
we consider the Inside of the Church by itself, as enclosed by its
Pillars and Columns, we discover it to be of an oval Figure; whereas if
we view the whole Space of it without these Pillars, it is a perfect
Square. For the upper and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> the lower Galleries, which are the Wings of
the Church, adjoin to it in such a Manner, that if we measure it from
the Pavement to the Bottom of the Curvature of the upper Galleries,
’tis of a square Figure, but as contracted within the Enclosure of
the four large and the four smaller Pillars, as far as the Curvature
of the four Arches of the <i>Dome</i>, it is entirely of an oval Form. The
Form of the Galleries is as follows: On three Sides of them they are
built in a square Manner: The fourth Side of them, which looks into
the Church, is of an oval Figure, as is the Church itself. The Roofs
of these Galleries are supported with Arches and Columns. I shall
give the Reader a Description of three of them, by which means he may
easily form a Judgment of the rest, for they are all of one Form.
Those I shall take Notice of, are the three upper Galleries on the
North Side of the Church. The first of these Galleries has two Fronts,
and looks both Eastward and Northward. The two Sides of this Gallery
rise from the Wall of the Church, and end in an Arch. In the Middle
of each Side of it there are three square Columns five Foot and nine
Inches in Circumference, which are made the Jambs of the Windows. These
Pillars support three other square Pillars, which are all made of
blue and white Marble. The Side which faces the Body of the Church is
adorn’d with six Pillars of green Marble, standing below the Arch which
supports an Eastern <i>Semi-dome</i>, whose Shafts at the Bottom of them
are seven Foot and eight Digits in Compass. The <i>Intercolumniations</i>
of these Pillars being little less than seven Foot and eleven Digits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
wide, are strengthen’d with Marble <i>Closures</i> which are four Foot
high, so that those who lean upon them, have a full View of all the
upper and lower Part of the Church. That Side which parts the first
and second Gallery, reaching from the outward Wall Northward, to the
great Pillar which supports the <i>Dome</i>, is forty four Foot in Length,
part of which is adorn’d with Pillars, and an Arch which supports the
<i>Dome</i>. You pass through this into the second Gallery, the Breadth of
which is twenty four Foot, and it is made up of the Arch of a Pillar,
and a Wall which is a part of one of the Wings of the Church, and
extends itself as far as the Roof of the <i>Dome</i>. This Gallery, at both
Ends of it, is born up by Arches and Walls. In the Middle of it, it
is supported by four white Pillars speckled with blue, the Shafts of
which are seven Foot in Compass. ’Tis of a square Figure, and, as I
observ’d, bears upon Arches and Walls. These Arches, at one End of
them, rise behind two of the large Pillars which support the <i>Dome</i>;
at the other End they bear upon Pillars which rise within Side of the
Walls, and support the four large Pillars. The outer Side of this
Gallery is supported with eight square Pillars, which are six Foot in
Compass. There rises in the Middle of them a Pillar of a larger Size.
These Pillars are instead of Jambs for the Windows; and above them
there are other Pillars, which are also Jambs to other Windows. These
Windows, which below and above are sixteen in Number, do very much
enlighten this second or Middle Gallery. The Front of this Gallery,
facing the Church, is beautified with six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span> Pillars of green Marble. The
<i>Intercolumniations</i> of them, like those of the first Gallery, have
their Marble <i>Closures</i> at Bottom. From this middle Gallery you pass
through an Arch into the third Gallery, which is much like the first
in its Length, Windows, Jambs and Pillars. The Roof of it is supported
with four Pillars, and the Side of it towards the Church with six green
Pillars. There are also four green Marble Pillars which support one
of the Western <i>Semi-domes</i> which stands between two other Pillars.
These Pillars stand two and two together, and between them are rais’d
two lesser Pillars, made after the <i>Ionic</i> Order. At the Western Door
of the Church there are instead of a <i>Vestibulum</i>, two <i>Portico’s</i>,
the lower of which lies upon a Level with the Church itself. The upper
leads to the Womens Galleries. Both of them in Length the Wideness of
the Church, and twenty eight Foot in Breadth. The <i>Portico</i> over it is
situate between the Pillars which support the Western <i>Semi-dome</i> and
the Windows. For both in the Inside and Outside of it, ’tis supported
with eight Pillars, between which, the Windows both in the upper and
lower Galleries, cast a great Light into the Church. There is nothing
parts this <i>Portico</i> and the Womens Galleries, but the Pillars which
bear up the Roof of the <i>Portico</i>; for the Pavement of the <i>Portico</i>
lies upon the same Level with the Pavement of the Galleries. The Inside
of the lower <i>Portico</i> is enclosed with Walls, which are lined with
a delectable Variety of Marble, and is cover’d at Top with curious
<i>Moresco Mosaick</i> Work, very beautifully gilded. On the East Side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the <i>Portico</i> are Doors which open into the Church; on the West End
of it you go out at five Brass folding Doors into a <i>Portico</i> that
stands without the Church, and from thence you pass into a Court,
where there are several Springs constantly running, to which there is
a very deep Descent by many Steps. At the Ends of these <i>Portico’s</i>
there are two Places of Entrance into the Church, one on the Northern
Side of it, and another with six folding Doors on the South. These
Doors formerly were all of Brass, at present three only of them are
so, but curiously wrought. The Church has also two folding Doors on
the East Side of it. There are also some Doors in the Sides of it,
which were formerly open’d, but are now kept shut. The Inside of the
Church is very light, by reason of the Multitude of Windows about it.
The high Wall, which between the great Arches and the <i>Cupola</i> is of
a circular Figure, let in the Light at forty Windows. The Walls under
the Arches are enlighten’d with twenty six Windows, the Middle of the
Galleries with thirty two, and the Ends of them with more than twenty.
I shall take no Notice of the Lights of the two Western and the four
lower Galleries, nor those of the two <i>Semi-domes</i>, nor those of the
<i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, and the upper <i>Portico</i>, which I omitted to count,
by reason of the great Number of them. The largest Entrance into this
Church is on the West Side of it, where you do not ascend the Pavement
as formerly, and as the <i>Romans</i> did their <i>Pantheon</i>, nor do you
descend into it by five Steps. You go up to the Top of the Church by
four Pair of winding Stairs, not winding round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> in the Manner of a
Cockle-shell, as <i>Cedrinus</i> reports, but turning more upon the Square,
and work’d by the Line. These Stairs rise with a very easy Ascent,
and are cut out of large Marble Tables. Every Turning of these Stairs
is nineteen Foot and a half high, and five Foot broad. Above these
there is another Pair of winding Stairs which reach to the Top of the
Church. You must ascend these when you go to the upper Galleries, and
<i>Portico’s</i>. If the Reader will give himself the Trouble to compare
what I have said of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, with what has been
written by <i>Procopius</i> and <i>Agathius</i> upon that Subject, he may easily
discover, that the Ruins of what was built by <i>Justinian</i> have not been
so great as the <i>Turks</i> pretend, who tell you, that the Church was
formerly much larger, and that several Parts of it have been pull’d
down by the <i>Barbarians</i>, and that there is scarce a tenth Part of it
remaining at this Day. This Story would carry a Face of Probability
in it, if they meant, that the Palaces, the Houses of the Priests and
the Noblemen, which were built about it, had been demolish’d by Fire,
and the Ravage of those People, otherwise I am convinc’d ’tis a gross
Mistake; for I saw every Part of the old Church standing, mention’d
by <i>Procopius</i>, except one <i>Portico</i>. For whereas <i>Procopius</i> writes,
that the Church had two <i>Portico’s</i> at each End of it, there is
none, remaining at present, but only that at the West End. ’Tis very
probable that the other was thrown down by an Earthquake, and that in
the Room of it, the Inhabitants erected a large Lump of Building of
square Stone, which is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span> standing, to support the East end of the
Church. This Lump of Stone you would take to be a Piece of a craggy
Rock, though it does not seem, by reason of the Earthquakes, to be of
the same Height as it was when it was first built, yet is it as near
as high, as <i>Evagrius</i> mentions it to be. Since which, to fortify the
labouring Pillars, it is lengthen’d with four Walls. These Walls are
more than twenty Foot long and eight Foot broad, rising to the Height
of the great Pillars, and seem, to speak in the Terms of Architecture,
to be Wings to the Church, or rather Buttresses, by which the North
and South Side of it are strengthen’d and supported. Both Ends of the
Church, which project beyond the eight Pillars, extending themselves
each into a <i>Semi-dome</i>, and rising at Top into an arched Form, are
yet remaining. The same lower Galleries for the Men, and the same
upper Galleries for the Women, the whole Roof, the same Walls and
Pillars, the same Dimensions of the Church, as originally beautify’d
and adorn’d, are still in Being. There are indeed some Flaws in the
Building, occasion’d by those who opposed the setting up of Images in
the Church. In short, the whole, and every part of it, is to be seen
at present; and it is despoiled of nothing, except a little of the
Metal-work, which shews itself in great abundance through the whole
Church. The <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, formerly holy and unpolluted, into
which the Priests only were suffer’d to enter, is yet standing, though
there is nothing remaining of the Jewels and precious Stones which
adorn’d it, as having been plunder’d by its sacrilegious Enemies. That
inimitable Table, given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> to the Church by its Founder <i>Justinian</i>,
made of the different Materials of Gold, Silver, all Kinds of Wood,
costly Stones, which either the Sea or the whole World could produce,
and which was embellish’d and enrich’d with infinite Offerings of
Emperors, Popes, Princes, and Ladies of the first Quality; among whom
was <i>Pulcheria</i>, the Daughter of <i>Arcadius</i>, and Sister of <i>Theodosius
the Less</i>, is at present despoil’d of all its fine Decorations.
<i>Sozomen</i> tells us, that this Table was a very beautiful and surprizing
Ornament to the Church, which was endow’d with very ample Donations,
the <i>Mahometan</i> Priests being now in Possession of them. They have
eleven hundred Shops and publick Houses, situate in the best Markets
of the City, which pay them a constant Revenue or Rent, without any
Deductions, for their Maintenance and Support.</p>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i> writes, that there was built near the Promontory
<i>Ceras</i>, a high Watch-Tower, which was call’d <i>Pharos</i>, and was a Guide
to the Ships at a great Distance. The Situation of this <i>Pharos</i>, in
all Probability, was near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. For from what
Part of the City could it spread a more convenient and diffusive
Light to those who sail’d out of the <i>Bosporus</i> and the <i>Propontis</i>?
<i>Dionysius</i> calls it the <i>Bosporian Promontory</i>, and tells us, that
<i>Io</i>, the Daughter of <i>Inachus</i>, provoked by <i>Juno</i>’s Resentment
against her, passed over from thence into <i>Asia</i>. The Place call’d the
<i>Mangana</i> was their Armoury, where they kept their Ordnance. It stood
in the Imperial Precinct, or by it, near the Chops of the <i>Bosporus</i>.
The Emperor <i>Constantine</i>, Surnamed <i>Monomachus</i>, built a handsome and

<p class="dropcap2">THESE <i>Bagnio’s</i> were so call’d, as <i>Cedrinus</i> relates, because they
were built in a Place, where formerly had stood the Temple of <i>Jupiter
Zeuxippus</i>. This is said of them by <i>Eusebius</i>, who writes, <i>That there
are some of Opinion, that the fine Bathing-place at</i> Constantinople
<i>took its Name from the famous Painter</i> Zeuxes, <i>whose Pieces adorn’d
it</i>. I collect that it stood near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, not only
from the <i>Treatise</i> of the <i>ancient Description</i> of the City, which
places them both in the same <i>Ward</i>, but also from the Fire which
happen’d in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, and burnt down, as <i>Procopius</i>
observes, the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and the adjacent Buildings, as
the <i>Bagnio</i> of <i>Zeuxippus</i>, and the House of Entrance before the
Palace; and <i>Zonaras</i> writes, that <i>Severus</i> the Emperor join’d it
to the <i>Hippodrom</i>, and built it on the same Spot of Ground, where
formerly had stood the Temple of <i>Jupiter</i>. <i>Leontius</i>, a more ancient

<p><i>Cedrinus</i> relates, that in this <i>Bagnio</i> there was a pleasant Variety
of Prospects of surprizing Art, both in Marble and Stone-work, in
Statues of Brass, and Figures of Persons of Antiquity, who seem’d
to want nothing but a Soul to animate and enliven them. Among these
celebrated Pieces of the most exquisite Workmanship, was the Statue of
old <i>Homer</i>, in a thoughtful Posture, just as he was, his Hands folded
in his Breast, his Beard carelessly hanging down, his Hair very thin
before, his Face wrinkled with Age, and the Cares of the World; his
Nose well proportion’d, his Eyes fix’d in their Sockets, as is usual
with blind Persons, which he was generally look’d upon to be. Over his
close Coat hung a loose Garment, and under his Feet, upon the Pedestal
of the Pillar, was a Bridle in Brass. This Place was also beautify’d
with the brazen Statues of all those renown’d Personages who had
been famous for Wisdom, Poetry, Oratory or Courage, throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span> the
World, but were all destroy’d by Fire. Among these were the Statues
of <i>Deiphobus</i>, <i>&AElig;schines</i>, <i>Demosthenes</i>, <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Euripides</i>,
<i>Hesiod</i>, <i>Theocritus</i>, <i>Simonides</i>, <i>Anaximenes</i>, <i>Calchas</i>,
<i>Pyrrhus</i>, <i>Amymone</i>; of <i>Sappho</i>, <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Venus</i>, <i>Chrysa</i>, <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>Plato</i>, <i>Hermaphroditus</i>, <i>Herinna</i>, <i>Terpander</i>, <i>Pericles</i>,
<i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Stesichorus</i>, <i>Democritus</i>; of <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Aurora</i>,
<i>&AElig;neas</i>, <i>Creusa</i>, <i>Helenus</i>, <i>Andromachus</i>, <i>Menelaus</i>, <i>Helena</i>,
<i>Ulysses</i>, <i>Hecuba</i>, <i>Cassandra</i>, <i>Polyxena</i>, <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Paris</i>, and his
<i>Oenone</i>; of <i>Milo</i>, <i>Dares</i> and <i>Entellus</i>, <i>Charidemus</i>, <i>Melampus</i>,
<i>Panthous</i>, <i>Demogeron</i>, <i>Isocrates</i>, <i>Amphiaraus</i>, <i>Sarpedon</i>,
<i>Achilles</i>, <i>Mercury</i>, <i>Apuleius</i>, <i>Diana</i>, <i>Pherecydes</i>, <i>Heraclitus</i>,
<i>Cratinus</i>, <i>Menander</i>, <i>Amphitryon</i>, <i>Thucydides</i>, <i>Herodotus</i>,
<i>Pindar</i>, <i>Xenophon</i>, <i>Alcm&aelig;on</i>, <i>Pompey</i> and <i>Virgil</i>. There were also
many other Statues which have been describ’d in Verse by <i>Christodorus</i>
a Poet of <i>Thebes</i>, or, as others report, a Native of <i>Coptos</i> in
<i>&AElig;gypt</i>, which, were it not a Work of Prolixity, I would explain to the
Reader. There stood near the <i>Bagnio</i> call’d <i>Zeuxippum</i>, a small Bath,
taken Notice of by <i>Leontius</i> in the following Lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Let not thy stately Walls, O proud</i> Zeuxippum,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Resent the Meanness of this little Bath</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>In Heaven’s high Tower, near the Constellation</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Of</i> Ursa Major <i>shines the</i> Polar <i>Star</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is nothing of the <i>Zeuxippum</i> remaining at present, nor of many
other fine <i>Bagnio’s</i>, although we have many Inscriptions relating to
them; as of that famous one celebrated by <i>Agathius</i>, in which <i>Venus</i>
is said to have bathed her self; also of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span> call’d <i>Didymum</i>,
in which both Sexes used to wash, describ’d in Verse by <i>Paulus
Silentiarius</i>, and a third made memorable by an Inscription of the
learned <i>Leontius</i>. Besides these, there was another named <i>Cupido</i>,
describ’d by the ingenious <i>Marianus</i>; yet are all of them either
entirely ruin’d, or so defaced by the <i>Mahometans</i>, that you cannot
discover who built them, or to whom they belong’d.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Hospitals of</i> Sampson <i>and</i> Eubulus.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>THERE was built</i>, as <i>Procopius</i> says, <i>a Hospital for the Relief of
poor and sick People. It was founded in ancient Times by a holy Man,
whose Name was</i> Sampson. <i>But it did not escape the Flames, occasion’d
by a riotous Mob, which burnt down that and the Church of St.</i> Sophia.
<i>It was rebuilt by</i> Julian, <i>who beautify’d and enlarged it with a
Multitude of small handsome Apartments, and afterwards endow’d it with
a yearly Stipend, for the Support and Comfort of the miserable and
distressed. But the good Emperor not being content with this Oblation
he had made to God, with the Co-assistance of his Imperial Consort</i>
Theodora, <i>built over-against it two other Hospitals on the same
Ground, where formerly stood the Houses of</i> Isidorus <i>and</i> Arcadius.
Thus far <i>Procopius</i>. From whence I would observe, that the Hospital
of <i>Sampson</i> was not far from the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
read in the History of an unknown Author, that it stood over-against
it. I am confirm’d in this Opinion by the Authority of <i>Zonaras</i>, who
tells us in the like Manner, that there was a Fire occasion’d by a
Faction, which burnt down the <i>great Church</i>, that of St. <i>Irene</i>, the
Hospital of <i>Eubulus</i>, the <i>Chalca</i>, the <i>Bagnio</i> of <i>Severus</i>, call’d
the <i>Zeuxippum</i>, and many other Buildings. This is farther attested
by <i>Cedrinus</i>, who speaking of the same Fire, tells us, <i>That a great
Part of the City, the Churches of St.</i> Sophia <i>and St.</i> Irene, <i>the
Hospitals of</i> Sampson <i>and</i> Eubulus, <i>with the sick People inhabiting
them, as also the</i> Augustean <i>Gate-house of the</i> Basilica, <i>the</i>
Chalca, <i>the two</i> Portico’s, <i>as far as the</i> Forum, <i>the</i> Octogon <i>and
the</i> Bagnio <i>of</i> Zeuxippus, <i>were destroy’d by Fire</i>. After I had made
the former Quotation from the printed Works of <i>Procopius</i>, I lighted
by chance upon a Manuscript of him, wherein I was inform’d, that the
Hospital of <i>Sampson</i> stood between the two Churches of St. <i>Sophia</i>
and St. <i>Irene</i>.</p>

paid their Homage and Acclamations to this Statue. There were publick
Entertainments of Dancing, and other mimical Gestures acted before it,
according to a Custom which had long prevail’d, of paying Adoration to
the Images of Princes. St. <i>Chrysostom</i> reflecting upon this Practice,
as contrary to the Precepts of the Christian Religion, publickly
condemn’d it in a <i>Sermon</i>. <i>Eudoxia</i> believing her self to be closely
struck at in that Discourse, banish’d him. I should here take Notice

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the</i> Hippodrom, <i>its</i> Obelisk, <i>its</i> Statues, <i>and</i> Columns.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">Modern Historians, as <i>Zonaras</i> and others, write, that the <i>Hippodrom</i>
was built by <i>Severus</i> upon his Reconciliation with the <i>Byzantians</i>.
<i>Zosimus</i>, a more ancient Writer tells us, that it was built, and
curiously beautified by <i>Constantine the Great</i>, part of which he
made the Temple of <i>Castor</i> and <i>Pollux</i>, whose Images remain’d in
the <i>Portico’s</i> of the <i>Hippodrom</i> down to his Time; that is, ’till
the Reign of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>. In the middle of the <i>Circo</i>,
which the <i>Greeks</i> call the <i>Hippodrom</i>, there stood an <i>Obelisk</i>
made of <i>Thebaick</i> Stone; but as the <i>ancient Description of the
Wards</i> takes no Notice of it, tho’ it does of the Square <i>Thebaick
Obelisk</i> in the fifth <i>Ward</i>, I should be inclin’d to believe, that
the <i>Obelisk</i>, I am speaking of, was overturn’d by an Earth-quake, and
remov’d by <i>Theodosius</i> into the <i>Hippodrom</i>, after that Treatise was
wrote, if the Author had not taken notice of many of <i>Theodosius</i>’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Works, and omitted some Things in the <i>Wards</i>, which he afterwards
mention’d in his <i>General View of the City</i>. ’Tis very probable, that
<i>Constantinople</i> had more <i>Obelisks</i> than one. As to that taken notice
of in the fifth <i>Ward</i>, it is not now remaining. When first I arriv’d
at <i>Constantinople</i> I saw two of them, one in the <i>Circus Maximus</i>,
another in the Imperial Precinct, standing on the North-side of the
first Hill. This last was of a square Figure, and was erected near the
Houses of the <i>Grand Seignor</i>’s Glaziers. A little time after I saw
it lying prostrate without the Precinct, and found it to be thirty
five Foot in Length. Each of its Sides, if I mistake not, was six Foot
broad, and the whole was eight Yards in Compass. It was purchased by
<i>Antonius Priolus</i>, a Nobleman of <i>Venice</i>, who sent it thither, and
placed it in St. <i>Stephen</i>’s Market. The other is standing in the
<i>Hippodrom</i> to this Day. ’Tis supported by four square broad Pieces of
Brass, each a Foot and a half high, with a Base and a Pedestal of the
same Height. From the Ground there rise two Steps against the Pedestal,
the lowermost of which is a Foot high, and of the same Breadth: The
upper Step is two Foot high, and projects four Foot and four Fingers
Breadth beyond the Pedestal. The Steps are not laid within the
Pedestal, but are join’d to it withoutside, as appears by the Cement.
Upon the Steps stands the Pedestal, which is every way twelve Foot
broad, four Foot eight Digits in Height and projects beyond the Base a
Foot and a half: Somewhat above a Foot higher it is more contracted,
and does not project beyond its Base; for from the Top of the Pedestal
there’s a Fluting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> on the four Sides of the <i>Obelisk</i> which
is cut out of the same Stone of which the Pedestal is made, and is a
Foot and thirteen Digits high. The Corners of the Top of the Pedestal
are worn, and defac’d, but are repair’d by four Stones of <i>Thebaick
Porphyry</i> Marble, each of them a Foot and a half high; for all the
fluted Part of the Pedestal that lies between these four angular
Stones, together with the upper Part of it, support the Base, which is
seven Foot and thirteen Digits high, and projects a Foot and a half
beyond the Bottom of the Shaft of the <i>Obelisk</i>, to the Breadth of
nine Foot, and as many Digits: ’Tis carv’d on all Sides, as is also
the Pedestal, which is covered with curious Statues cut in <i>Basso
Relievo</i>. The Sculptures on the North-side of it, stand in two Ranges,
the lowermost of which contains eighteen Statues, and two Cap-stands,
which are turn’d round with Iron Crows by four Men, and wind the Ropes,
which are drawn through Pullies, round the Cap-stand, and so draw the
<i>Obelisk</i> along the Ground. In the same Range is engraved the <i>Obelisk</i>
in an upright Posture, as it now stands, with three Statues, one of
which, as the Inhabitants tell you, represents the Master, and the
other the Servant, whom he design’d to correct, if a third Person had
not interposed, because he had erected the <i>Obelisk</i> in his Absence.
In the upper Range there are also the Figures of two Cap-stands, with
the same Number of Men working them, and labouring with those below
them, to drag the <i>Obelisk</i>. The Wreaths of the Ropes in particular,
are very nicely cut. If the Reader could apprehend the manner in which
this cumbersome Pillar was erected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> I believe he would judge it was
done the way, as <i>Marcellinus</i> describes. There was nothing wanting,
says he, but the Erection of the <i>Obelisk</i>, the Accomplishment of
which, without the greatest Danger, could scarcely be conceiv’d. You
might see, says he, a vast Wood of Scaffolding made of tall Beams: At
the Top of these were fix’d large, and long Ropes, after the manner of
Threads in a Weaver’s Loom; which by their Thickness and Closeness to
one another, darkned the Air. These Ropes at the Bottom were fastned
round the <i>Obelisk</i>, which being leisurely drawn into the Air, many
thousands working at the Cap-stands, was at last fix’d upon its
<i>Basis</i>. I believe there are at present Engineers at <i>Constantinople</i>,
who could do the same thing. I am induc’d to think so, by what I
observ’d of a Pillar on the Side of the fifth Hill, which was almost
equal in Magnitude to this <i>Obelisk</i>. I saw this Pillar taken off its
<i>Basis</i>, and laid upon the Ground in the following manner. Round the
Pillar, though at some Distance from it, they fix’d in the Ground near
to one another large Poles, much taller than the Pillar, at an equal
Distance from each other. At the Top of these Poles, they laid others
across them, which were fasten’d to them in the strongest manner, and
to which were fix’d the Pullies, through which the Ropes slipp’d,
which reach’d from the Bottom of the Shaft of the Pillar to the Top,
and were fasten’d to it: The Ropes were so thick, both length-ways
and cross-ways, that at some Distance the Scaffolding look’d like a
square Tower. There were many Cap-stands on all Sides fix’d in the
Ground, which were turn’d by infinite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> Numbers of the strongest Youth,
till they had mov’d it from its <i>Basis</i>, and laid it prostrate with
the Earth. They afterwards laid it upon strong Carriages, the Wheels
of which were bound with thick Iron, and brought it safe to the third
Hill, and set it up as an Ornament to the <i>Mosque</i> of <i>Solyman</i> the
Emperor. But to return to the <i>Obelisk</i>; on the West-side of the
Pedestal was the following Inscription in <i>Greek</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>To raise this Four-square Pillar to its Height</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>And fix it steddy on its solid Base</i>,</div>

<div class="line"><i>In two and thirty Days, by</i> Proclus’ <i>Skill</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>The toilsome Work, with great Applause, was finish’d</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">And on the other Side was this Inscription in <i>Latin</i>,
which was somewhat defac’d, but I could
read it, and is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Difficilis quondam dominis parere serenis</i></div>

<div class="line"><i>Judice sub</i> Proclo, <i>sublime elatus ad auras</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">On the South Side of it there are two Ranges of Statues, the lowermost
of which has engrav’d upon it four Chariots, two of which are drawn by
a Pair, and the other by four Horses, with a Driver to each of them.
In the upper Range are two <i>Equestrian</i> Statues, three Footmen, three
<i>Togati</i>, two <i>Obelisks</i>, and four square Pillars. On the North Side
of the <i>Basis</i> are engrav’d four Ranges of Figures, which contain
thirty five Statues in Gowns. On the West Side there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span> two Ranges,
the lowest of which has nine Statues in a suppliant Posture, making
Presents to the Emperor, who stands in the upper Range, with sixteen
Statues about him. The South Side has two Ranges; upon the lowest are
cut ten Statues in Gowns, in a petitioning manner; the upper contains
twenty Statues, all in Gowns, except four in a fighting Posture, arm’d
with Bucklers. The East Side, on the lowest part of it, has three
Ranges; the lowest Range contains sixteen Statues of Men and Women,
dancing and playing upon Instruments of Musick; above which are two
Ranges more, in which appear little more than the Heads, which I look
upon to be the Spectators. The highest Range has twenty Statues, six
of which are divided from the rest by Pillars. The middle Figure
holds a Crown in his Hand. Upon the <i>Basis</i> are four square Pieces
of Brass carv’d, which being plac’d in a quadrilateral Figure, the
whole <i>Obelisk</i> bears upon them. ’Tis engrav’d from Top to Bottom with
<i>&AElig;gyptian</i> Characters.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the</i> Colossus.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THERE is yet standing, in the Middle of the <i>Hippodrom</i>, a <i>Colossus</i>
made of square Stones, which was formerly (as an injudicious Author
writes) incrusted with Marble; but, as appears by an Inscription carv’d
upon its <i>Basis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> ’twas cover’d with Plates of Brass, cramp’d together
with Iron, as appears not only by the Holes made in the Shaft, but
by those which still remain in the <i>Base</i>; where the Iron Pins were
fasten’d, and strengthen’d with melted Lead. ’Tis now despoil’d of its
outward beauteous Appearance; and discovers only the Workmanship of its
Inside, as having felt the Effects of the Avarice and Rapine of the
<i>Barbarians</i>. This was also the Fate of the <i>Colossus</i> at <i>Rhodes</i>,
which was demolish’d by the <i>Hagarens</i> in the Reign of <i>Constans</i>,
Nephew of <i>Heraclius</i>, thirteen hundred Years after it was erected.
’Twas purchas’d afterwards by one <i>Emesenus</i> a <i>Jew</i>, and the Brass,
when strip’d off, was of so considerable a Weight, that it was carried
off by Nine hundred Camels. Upon the <i>Base</i> of the <i>Colossus</i> at
<i>Constantinople</i>, are inscrib’d the following Verses;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>Fam’d</i> Constantine, Romanus’ <i>Princely Son</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>(Who wore with Honour the Imperial Crown)</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>This lofty Pile, by Time decay’d, repair’d</i>;</div>
<div class="line"><i>And join’d fresh Beauty to her Builder’s Art</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This <i>Colossus</i> at the <i>Base</i> of it, has three Steps. The lowest is
two Foot high, the next a Foot and two Digits, and the uppermost of
the same Height. The <i>Basis</i> is a square Marble, seven Foot and three
Digits high, each Side of which is ten Foot and nine Inches broad. This
<i>Colossus</i> is taller than the <i>Obelisk</i>. One Day, being the <i>Festival</i>
of the Circumcision of the Prince of <i>Boldania</i>, I saw an ingenious
Fellow of a Mountebank climb to the Top of it, and come down safe.
The same Attempt was immediately made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> by another, who made a Shift
to reach the Top of it, but the Height so dazzled and confounded him,
that, despairing of getting down without Hurt, he threw himself, with
all his Might, as far as he could from the <i>Colossus</i>, to avoid the
Danger of being dash’d to pieces upon the Foundation; so that falling
down right upon his Feet, he stuck deep in the Earth, and dy’d upon the
Spot.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="Book_II_Chap_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="inblk"><i>Of some other Columns in the</i> Hippodrom.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">ABOUT the Middle of the <i>Hippodrom</i>, among a strait Range of small
<i>Obelisks</i>, there stand seven Pillars. One of which, made of <i>Arabian</i>
Marble, is seventeen Foot and eight Digits in Circumference. There
was erected upon the Top of it, by one <i>Abraham</i> a Basha, the Statue
of <i>Hercules</i>. It was cast in Brass, and made of the Spoils which he
had taken in <i>Hungary</i>; but upon the Death of <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Hercules</i>,
who was reported to have travell’d so many Countries, and tam’d so
many Monsters, was at last forced to submit, and be torn to pieces by
the <i>Turks</i>, the most inveterate Enemies to <i>Statuary</i>, and the whole
<i>Vitruvian</i> Art; so that they treated him in as barbarous a manner as
he was by <i>Diagoras</i>, who going into an Inn, and wanting Wood to boil
his Lentils, finding a wooden Statue of <i>Hercules</i>, well-finish’d,
cut it to pieces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> and threw it into the Fire, saying these Words;
<i>O Hercules, who hast pass’d with so much Courage through thy twelve
Labours, try how thou canst struggle with the thirteenth</i>.</p>

<p>In the same Range of <i>Obelisks</i> there stands another Pillar. ’Tis made
of Brass, but not fluted, but wreath’d round with the Foldings of
three Serpents, like those we see in great Ropes. The Heads of these
Serpents are placed in a triangular Form, and rise very high upon the
Shaft of the Pillar. There are many fabulous and trifling Reports
among the Inhabitants, concerning the Erection of this Pillar, which
is occasion’d by their Ignorance of the History of their Ancestors.
<i>Zosimus</i>, among other Historians, writes, that <i>Constantine</i> the
<i>Great</i> plac’d in the <i>Hippodrom</i> the <i>Tripos</i> of <i>Apollo</i>, which was
brought from <i>Delphos</i>, and which had on it the Image of that God.
<i>Sozomen</i> tells us, that <i>Constantine</i> did not only place the <i>Delphick
Tripos</i> in the <i>Hippodrom</i>, but also that celebrated <i>Tripos</i>, which
<i>Pausanias</i> the <i>Laced&aelig;monian</i> General, and the Cities of <i>Greece</i>,
upon the Conclusion of the War with the <i>Medes</i>, consecrated to
<i>Apollo</i>. <i>Eusebius</i> is more clear upon this Occasion, and says,
that <i>Constantine</i>, in some part of <i>Constantinople</i>, see up the
Image of <i>Sminthius Apollo</i>, which was a Title given to him; but that
in the <i>Hippodrom</i> he placed the <i>Pythian Tripos</i>, round which was
wreathed the Figure of the Serpent <i>Python</i>; so that it seems to me
very probable, that this was the same <i>Tripos</i> which was plac’d upon
the brazen Pillar I am speaking of at <i>Constantinople</i>. <i>Herodotus</i>
writes, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span> golden <i>Tripos</i> which was at <i>Delphos</i>, was made
out of a tenth Part of the Spoils taken from the <i>Persians</i>, and
erected upon this Pillar; and adds farther, that when the <i>Persians</i>
were routed at the Battle of <i>Plat&aelig;&aelig;</i>, there was found a golden
<i>Tripos</i>, which was restor’d to <i>Apollo</i>, and set upon a brazen
Pillar, encircled with three Serpents entwin’d, near an Altar. ’Tis a
Mistake in those who imagine, that this Pillar was formerly overlaid
with Gold, but was plunder’d of it by the <i>Turks</i>; since <i>Pausanias</i>
makes it appear, that it was stripp’d of its Gold long before the
<i>Turks</i> took <i>Constantinople</i>. <i>After the Battle of Plat&aelig;&aelig;</i>, says
he, <i>the</i> Greeks <i>made a common Offering to</i> Apollo, <i>which was a
golden</i> Tripos, <i>supported by a brazen Serpent</i>. The Brass, he tells
us, remain’d whole in his Time, but the Gold was carry’d off by the
<i>Phocean</i> Generals. There are five other Pillars in the same Range.
In the Front of the <i>Hippodrom</i>, facing the <i>Propontis</i>, there was
a Range of seventeen Pillars of white Marble standing, when first I
came to <i>Constantinople</i>. They stood on the South-west Side of the
<i>Hippodrom</i>. The <i>Pedestal</i> of each of them is two Foot and ten Digits
high, and are all of them supported by arch’d Foundations, which lye
Level with the Plain of the <i>Hippodrom</i>, but rise above Ground to the
Height of fifty Foot. They are all placed upon a little Wall, which
projects two Steps, or square Plinths, the lowermost of which is a
Foot and a Digit high; the upper is a Foot and six Digits high, and
projects beyond the Pedestal eight Digits. The Pedestals of them are
every way five Feet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> seven Inches broad. The lowest Projectures
of them, which are placed there for <i>Tores</i> and other <i>Modules</i>, are
six Digits and a half high, the upper Projectures of the same Height;
the <i>Plinth</i> of the <i>Cornice</i> is eleven Digits in Thickness; the lower
<i>Tore</i> seven Digits and a half; the <i>Scotia</i> four Digits; the upper
<i>Tore</i> six Digits; the Stone which supports the Shaft is five Digits
high, and the Shafts themselves three Foot five Digits in Diameter,
and twenty eight Foot in Height. These Pillars were lately taken down,
and the <i>Bases</i> of them removed by Order of <i>Solyman</i> the Emperor,
to build an Hospital. I was concern’d to see them thus demolish’d,
not so much for the Use they were intended, but that some of them
were squared out for paving a <i>Bagnio</i>, and that the <i>Capitals</i>, made
after the most exact Plans of ancient <i>Architecture</i>, were cut into
Rude and ill-shapen Models for covering a Bake-house, and that the
<i>Pedestals</i>, and all the <i>Entablature</i> were hewn out, it may be only
to build a Wall. The <i>Shafts</i> of the Pillars stood at eleven Foot
Distance. I observ’d the <i>Capitals</i> were impair’d by reason of the
great Space of Intercolumniation. The <i>Capitals</i> were finish’d after
the <i>Corinthian</i> Order, and the <i>Trabeation</i> was beautifully wrought,
but was not adorn’d with an <i>Ovolo</i>. There were Iron Rings fix’d to the
<i>Architraves</i>, upon which were hung Curtains. Beyond this was another
Range of Pillars, which were remaining some time after the Taking of
the City by the <i>Turks</i>. Before it was taken by the <i>Gauls</i> and the
<i>Venetians</i>, there were in the <i>Hippodrom</i> abundance of Figures of
Horses, both in Stone and Brass. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> four in particular of
surprizing Skill, which were gilded, equal in Beauty and Workmanship to
those which now stand before the Church of St. <i>Marcian</i> at <i>Venice</i>,
which, some say, were brought thither from <i>Constantinople</i>. I shall
omit the Statues of great Numbers of Emperors and Princes, which were
set up in the <i>Circo</i>. Among these stood the Statue of the Emperor
<i>Justinian</i>, which has been celebrated in Verse. There were also the
Statutes of some Eunuchs, who were most in the Interest and Favour
with their Masters. Among others, there was the Statue of <i>Plato</i> the
Eunuch, the Emperor’s Chamberlain, who was burnt to Death in the Reign
of <i>Basiliscus</i>. There was an Inscription, according to <i>Suidas</i>,
fix’d upon the Breast of this Statue, which ran thus; <i>Whosoever
shall remove this Statue into another Place, let him be hang’d</i>.
Yet was it taken out of the Church of <i>Procopius</i>, and carry’d into
the <i>Hippodrom</i>. I have not time to take Notice of the numberless
Statues of all the Combatants, Wrestlers, Charioteers, formerly placed
in the <i>Hippodrom</i>; of which, though there is nothing remaining at
present, yet the Memory of them is still preserved in a small Poem
of three hundred Verses, in which some Chariot-Racers are mention’d
with particular Honours, though no Notice be there taken of a Person
named <i>Thomas</i>, a Man of surprizing Agility and Speed, in that kind of
Exercise. I have seen the Fragment of a Stone at <i>Constantinople</i> with
this Inscription, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θομᾶ Ἡνιόχου</span>. This probably is the same
Person mention’d by the Emperor <i>Theodoric</i>, in a Letter to <i>Faustus</i>
a <i>Roman Pr&aelig;tor</i>, in the following Words: <i>Of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> Imperial Bounty
and Consideration we have given and granted to</i> Thomas, <i>the famous
Chariot-Racer, a present Stipend to be continued to him, till we have
farther experienced, and been fully satisfied of his wonderful Skill
in that Exercise; but having now received ample Testimony of his
Superiority in that Performance, and that having left his Countrey, he
hath chosen voluntarily to settle himself within our Dominions, we, out
of our Imperial Munificence, have encouraged him by a monthly Salary
to continue among us. He has, by his frequent Successes, received the
repeated Applauses, and stood high in the Favour of the People, whom he
has sometimes, though unfortunately, vindicated, and at other times has
eminently distinguish’d himself in the Race of the Chariot. Victory so
often attended him, that he was look’d upon as a Sorcerer by a Set of
People, who would have accounted it the highest Commendation to have
been thought so themselves, for the same Reasons. And ’tis no Wonder
that Men should ascribe those Excellencies to the Power of Sorcery
and Enchantment, which they cannot arrive to themselves, the Sight
of a Chariot-Race, in ancient Times, was had in the highest Honour
and Esteem, though at present ’tis little better than the Occasion
of Buffoonry, an Incentive to trifling Disputes, an Encouragement to
Roguery and Sharping, and the constant Source of Broils and Quarrels.</i>
Thus far the Emperor: From whose Words I would observe, that the
Chariot-Racer here mention’d, who had left <i>Constantinople</i>, probably
upon some Party Quarrels among the Chariot-Racers (who were therefore
call’d <i>Factions</i>) was also in Danger at <i>Rome</i>, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> the like
Account. The Commonwealth both of <i>Rome</i> and <i>Constantinople</i> have
not only been often harrass’d with such Commotions, but the Emperors
themselves have often fallen into the greatest Danger of losing their
Government by them. But all the Diversions of the <i>Circo</i> are now
ceased. I was concern’d to see it despoil’d of all its Ornaments,
though the <i>Turks</i> of late have begun to build there again. I was
the more concern’d, because, by looking casually upon a Medal I had
then in my Hand, it put me in mind of <i>Belisarius</i> triumphing in the
<i>Hippodrom</i>, after his Victory over the King of the <i>Vandals</i>, as also
of the Disgrace and Poverty, notwithstanding his Bravery and Courage,
he afterwards fell into by the Jealousy of the Emperor. On one Side of
it was stamp’d the triumphant Reception of <i>Belisarius</i>, and on the
other this Image, with this Inscription, <i>Gloria Romanorum Belisarius</i>.
<i>Procopius</i> writes, That there was a Gate in the <i>Hippodrom</i> call’d
the <i>Cochlia</i>, because it had winding Stairs within it. There was also
a Passage, through which they went to their Burial-Ground. The same
Writer tells us, that in the same Place there was a <i>Portico</i> call’d
<i>Venetia</i>, from the <i>Companies</i> or <i>Factions</i> of Chariot-Racers who
used to assemble there, and who distinguish’d themselves from other
<i>Factions</i> or <i>Companies</i>, by a <i>Sky-colour’d</i> Garment, which was
called so from the <i>Venetians</i>, a People that particularly affected
that Colour. ’Tis very probable, that the <i>Prasin Faction</i> had also
a <i>Portico</i> here. These were another Company of Charioteers, and
distinguish’d themselves by a <i>green</i> Livery. The Word <i>Prasina</i> being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πράσον</span> in the <i>Greek</i>, which signifies a <i>Leek</i>.
Nor is it unlikely, that there were other Companies with Liveries of
other Colours, who were not promiscuously crowded together, but seated
in their own Apartments in the <i>Portico’s</i>, to see the Races.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Church of</i> Bacchus, <i>the Court of</i> Hormisda, <i>and the House of</i>
Justinian.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">IT is observable from the Situation of the Church of <i>Bacchus</i> and
<i>Sergius</i>, now standing on the Plain between the <i>Propontis</i> and the
<i>Hippodrom</i>, that the Imperial Palace, and the House <i>Justinian</i> lived
in, before he was Emperor, stood near it. <i>Procopius</i> writes, that
<i>Justinian</i> built a Church, and dedicated it to St. <i>Peter</i> and St.
<i>Paul</i>. It stood near the Imperial Court, where formerly had stood a
Palace built by <i>Hormisda</i>. This, <i>Justinian</i> made a Mansion-house
for himself, that the Beauty and Elegancy of its Building might be an
Ornament to the Palace.</p>

<p>After he had arrived to the Imperial Dignity, he built other fine
Palaces about it, and near it built another Church in honour of two
illustrious Saints, <i>Sergius</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>. These Churches which are
both of them equally beautiful, stood on the same Compass of Ground,
nor is there any material Difference between them. They shine alike
with the most glossy Marble; both are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> curiously gilded, and adorn’d
with the richest Offerings, nor is there any thing wherein they do not
resemble each other, but that one is built lengthways, and the other
in a semicircular manner. They are both wonderful in their kind, and
are a great Ornament not only to the Palace, but to the whole City:
<i>Procopius</i> adds a little farther, that <i>Justinian</i> chang’d the House,
which was call’d the House of <i>Hormisda</i>, into a more magnificent
Figure, and join’d it to the Palace. I am of Opinion, that this
<i>Hormisda</i>, whom he dignifies with the Title of Prince, was the Son
of a King of <i>Persia</i>, who, as <i>Marcellinus</i> reports, when <i>Constans</i>
the Son of <i>Constantine</i> came to <i>Rome</i>, and glorying how far he would
transcend <i>Hormisda</i> in his immoderate Schemes of Building, being
unable to accomplish his Designs, he was content, he said, in an
humble manner, only to have such another Horse made as stood in the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Trajan</i>. The Story coming afterwards to <i>Hormisda</i>’s Ear,
he reply’d in a jocular manner, <i>Let him try first, if he can build a
Stable for him</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> explains more at large how near the House
of <i>Justinian</i> was to the Church of <i>Bacchus</i>: <i>Justinian</i>, says he,
<i>built the Church of</i> Sergius <i>and</i> Bacchus, <i>which on the Sea-side of
it, is near the Palace, and built also another Church by it, on the
same piece of Ground, on which had stood his own House: In building
these two Churches, and in founding a Monastery, which he fill’d with
Men of sound Learning, and exemplary Conversation, he laid out his
whole Estate, and all he was worth, till he arrived to the Imperial
Dignity</i>. There is nothing remaining at present of the Church of St.
<i>Peter</i> and St. <i>Paul</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> but the Church of <i>Sergius</i> and <i>Bacchus</i> are
yet standing. It goes still under its ancient Name, though the <i>Turks</i>
have changed it into a Mosque. ’Tis covered at top with a Brick Roof,
and bears upon eight Pilasters; between the Pilasters there are two
Ranges of Pillars of the <i>Ionick Order</i>. In the lowest Range, there are
sixteen Pillars which bear upon the Pavement: Six of these Pillars are
of Green Marble, and ten of white streak’d with Red Veins. The upper
Range consists of eighteen Pillars, eight of which are Green, ten White
Marble, and are vein’d as the other. The <i>Capitals</i> of the lower are
adorn’d with <i>Ovolo’s</i> at the Bottom of them. The upper part of them is
cover’d with a <i>Foliage</i>. The <i>Volut&aelig;</i> of the upper Range of Pillars
project from the four Angles of the <i>Capitals</i>, but the <i>Ovolo’s</i>
project from the Sides of them, which are also cover’d with a <i>Foliage</i>
of fine Workmanship. The <i>Architraves</i> over the <i>Capitals</i> of the
lower Range are finished with the nicest Art. There is a noble Piece
of Sculpture in this Church. ’Twas done by <i>Zoophorus</i>, who has carved
round the Church some <i>Greek</i> Verses, in the largest Characters. The
Tops of the <i>Pilasters</i> are shaded with a <i>Vineal Foliage</i>, intermixed
with cluster’d Grapes, which denote, that the Church was dedicated to
<i>Bacchus</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Port of</i> Julian, <i>and</i> Sophia; <i>of the</i> Portico <i>nam’d</i>
Sigma, <i>and the Palace of</i> Sophia.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">NEAR the Church of <i>Bacchus</i>, stood the Port of <i>Julian</i>. This is plain
from the Account we have of the Fire, which happen’d in the Reign of
<i>Leo</i> the <i>Great</i>, and as <i>Evagrius</i> tells us, began on the North-side
of the City, and destroy’d all before it, from the <i>Bosporian</i> Port,
to the old Temple of <i>Apollo</i>; and that on the South-side of the City,
it made the same Havock from the Port of <i>Julian</i>, to the Houses near
the Temple of <i>Concord</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, who has described the
Devastations of that Fire, that it burnt with great Fury from the
<i>Bosporium</i> to the Church of St. <i>John</i> the <i>Calybite</i>, and on the
South from the Church of St. <i>Thomas</i> to the Church of the renowned
Martyrs, <i>Sergius</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>. The Church of St. <i>Thomas</i> stood near
the Temple of <i>Concord</i>. The Account which <i>Cedrinus</i> gives of this
Fire is, that it took its Course round the City quite from the Northern
to the Southern Shore, as far as the Church of <i>Sergius</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>.
The Emperor <i>Anastasius</i> fortified the Port of <i>Julian</i>, and secured
it by a strong Wall. It was afterwards called the Port of <i>Sophia</i>,
according to <i>Cedrinus</i>, who writes, <i>That</i> Justin <i>the Nephew of</i>
Justinian, <i>built a Palace in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> Port of</i> Julian, <i>which he ordered
to be cleansed, and that he commanded his own, and the Statue of</i>
Sophia <i>his Consort to be erected there, and from thence gave it the
Name of the Port</i> of Sophia. The Inscription on the Statue of <i>Justin</i>
placed here is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>I</i> Theodorus, <i>Prefect of the City</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Here, on the Shore, erect this lofty Statue</i>;</div>
<div class="line"><i>It represents the Emperor</i> Justinus.</div>
<div class="line"><i>May his kind Presence guard, and ever shed</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Its peaceful Influence o’er the neighbouring Ports.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Procopius</i> writes, that the Church of the Martyr <i>Thecla</i> stood near
this Port. Some modern Historians tell us, that <i>Belisarius</i> set
Sail from this Port, when he went to Battel against the <i>Vandals</i>.
But I cannot conceive what Reason they have for that Opinion, unless
it be from some Words of <i>Procopius</i>, who says, that <i>Justinian</i>
commanded the Ship, in which the General sail’d, to be brought near
the Palace, and that there <i>Epiphanius</i> Bishop of <i>Constantinople</i>, as
was customary upon such Occasions, put up a Prayer for his Success,
and that then <i>Belisarius</i> went off with his Wife <i>Antonina</i>. There
were indeed some Palaces near this Port, but there were also other
Palaces near the Bay, which was full of Havens, from whence, at a
little Distance, stood the House of <i>Belisarius</i>. <i>Suidas</i> confirms
it, that <i>Anastasius</i> fortify’d this Harbour, and made a Pier there;
and <i>Zonaras</i> attests, that <i>Justin</i> built there some Palaces, and
call’d them the Palaces of <i>Sophia</i>, from the Name of his Consort, whom
he passionately loved. Many <i>Historians</i> are of Opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span> that these
Palaces stood near the Port of <i>Sophia</i>; but I am induced to think,
both from Reason and the Authority of learned Men, that it was not so.
For <i>Zonaras</i>, among others, writes, that <i>Justin</i> built these Palaces
against the City, and <i>Agathius</i>, a much ancienter Writer, and who was
living at the Time they were built, wrote the following Inscription,
which was fix’d upon them. From whence the Reader may observe, that
they were not seated near the <i>Propontis</i>, adjoining to which was the
Port of <i>Sophia</i>, but opposite to the City, near the Shore of the
<i>Bosporus</i>, where the Continent is divided into two Parts.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Agathius Scholasticus</i> upon the Palaces of<br />
<span class="smcap">Sophia</span>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The Word which in the Original Inscription is wrote <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δέρκεαι</span>,
<i>Zonaras</i> writes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δέρκεται</span>. ’Tis easy to discover from
these Verses, that the Palace of <i>Sophia</i> was not seated near the
<i>Bosporus</i>, but without the Walls of the City, waich is attested by
<i>Cedrinus</i>, and many other Historians, in their Descriptions of the
<i>hard Frost</i>, which happen’d in the Reign of <i>Leo Copronymus</i>, by which
the <i>Bosporus</i> was frozen so hard, that whosoever had a mind to pass
over from the Palace of <i>Sophia</i> to the City, or from <i>Chrysopolis</i>
to the Church of St. <i>Mamas</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> or repass to <i>Galata</i> on the Shore of
the <i>Bosporus</i>, might cross over the Ice without the least Danger. The
Port of <i>Sophia</i>, before it was call’d the Port of <i>Julian</i>, seems to
me to be the same, which was formerly called the <i>Neorium</i>, and which
the <i>ancient Description of the Wards</i> places in the same <i>Ward</i> with
the <i>Hippodrom</i>; but whether it be one, or either of these, it is now
fill’d up; or if it was that Port which stands West of the Church
of <i>Bacchus</i>, ’tis now almost demolish’d, and enclosed with a Wall.
There is only a small Part of it remaining, which is a standing Water,
where the Women wash their Linnen. The People tell you, that they have
seen some Three-Oar’d Gallies which have been sunk there. ’Tis call’d
at present by the Inhabitants <i>Caterga limena</i>, or the Port of the
Three-Oar’d Gallies; whether it be the same Port, which is standing on
the East of the Church of <i>Bacchus</i>, near the Gate of the City call’d
<i>Porta Leonis</i>, which Name it took either from a Lion near it, which
was carved in Stone, or from the Emperor <i>Leo</i>, who, they tell you,
had a Palace there, I shall not determine. <i>Nicephorus</i>, an Historian
of modern Date, tells us, that an Emperor of <i>Constantinople</i>, when
besieged by the People of <i>Italy</i>, summoned a Multitude of Smiths into
the <i>Morion</i>, which ran round the <i>Hippodrom</i>. I could never discover
at <i>Constantinople</i> the Place which was called the <i>Pyctacia</i>; yet I
cannot but take Notice from <i>Cedrinus</i>, and other modern Historians,
that in the Place which they called the <i>Pyctacia</i>, there was a
Pillar which supported the Statue of <i>Leo</i> the Emperor, the Consort
of <i>Verina</i>. This Statue, as some write, was erected by his Sister
<i>Euphemia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> a Lady of great Wisdom and Continency, near her own
House, where <i>Leo</i> every Week, used to pay her a Visit. All Persons
who laboured under Afflictions of any Kind, laid their Petitions to
the Emperor, upon the Steps of this Pillar. The Apparitors took them
up, and when the Emperor waited upon his Sister, they presented them
to him. <i>Bud&aelig;us</i> says, that the <i>Pyctacia</i>, or as he calls them, the
<i>Pystacia</i>, were Briefs; though I see no Reason why they may not also
be called Petitions. For as <i>Pyctium</i> signifies a Book, I do not see
why <i>Pyctacium</i> may not signify any smaller Writing. The <i>Greeks</i> at
present generally call their Letters <i>Pyctacia</i>. In an History written
by an unknown Author, I have read, that <i>Eudoxia</i> had set up her own
Statue, made of massy Silver, in a Place called the <i>Pyctacium</i>. If
the Author be not mistaken, I should take this to be the same Statue
which stood near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, by which, as I have shewn
before, stood the Statue of <i>Eudoxia</i>. I have seen a small <i>Treatise</i>
of <i>Constantinople</i>, which says, that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> built
a Church to St. <i>Euphemia</i>, near the <i>Hippodrom</i>, which was afterwards
turned into an Armory by <i>Constantine</i>, surnamed <i>Copronymus</i>, a
professed Adversary to Images in Churches, and who cast the Reliques
of St. <i>Euphemia</i> into the Sea. <i>Suidas</i> writes, that the Statue of
<i>Euphemia</i> (the Consort of the Emperor <i>Justin</i>, who was a <i>Thracian</i>)
was placed in the Church of St. <i>Euphemia</i>, which she her self had
built. Some modern Writers say, that in the Time of <i>Basilius</i> the
Emperor, there was a great Earthquake which overturned the Church of
St. <i>Polyclete</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span> and killed all that were in it; and that from that
Time it was called <i>Sigma</i>. I am more inclined to believe, that it took
its Name from a <i>Portico</i> so called, many Ages before this Earthquake,
because it was built after the Similitude of the Letter <i>Sigma</i>, and
is placed in the <i>antient Description</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, in the
same <i>Ward</i> with the <i>Hippodrom</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> seems to take Notice
of this Place. <i>They dragged</i>, says he, Michael <i>the Emperor in his
Monks Habit, by the Heels, out of the Monastery of</i> Studius, <i>through
the Market, and leading him beyond the Monastery called</i> Periblepton,
<i>in a Place called</i> Sigma, <i>they put out both his Eyes</i>. The same
Author tells us, that <i>Basilius</i> the Emperor, a Native of <i>Macedon</i>,
rebuilt from the Foundations, a Church to the Honour of the <i>Blessed
Virgin</i>, which was called <i>Sigma</i>. <i>Chrysaphius Zomas</i>, an Eunuch, set
up the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>, in a Place called <i>Sigma</i>.
Some Writers affirm, that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> built a Church to
St. <i>Stephen</i>, in a Place called <i>Sigma</i>. The <i>Sigma</i> therefore here
intended, must needs be another Place in the City, distinct from that
which I observed was in the third <i>Ward</i>, and ought to be written with
the Letter <i>e</i>, as <i>Segma</i>; by Reason, as I hinted just now, that the
Fall of the Church of St. <i>Polyclete</i> by an Earthquake, crushed to
Death all that were in it.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">IF the <i>Miliarium Aureum</i> had been now in Being, or the People of
<i>Constantinople</i> had preserved the Memory of its Situation, we might
easily discover, from the <i>antient Description of the Wards</i>, (which
tells us, that the fourth <i>Ward</i> extended it self, the Hills rising
on the Right and Left, from the <i>Miliarium Aureum</i> to a plain level
Ground) that it was in the first Valley, or on the Ridge of the Hill

Discovery from the Remains of the <i>August&aelig;um</i>, the <i>Basilica</i>, the

<i>August&aelig;um</i>, was surrounded with Pillars, and was situate before the
Imperial Palace. Not only the <i>Forum</i> is at present quite defaced,
but the very Name of it is lost, and the whole Ground where it stood
is built upon. The Palace is entirely in Ruines, yet I collect from
the <i>Pedestal</i> of a Pillar of <i>Justinian</i> lately standing, but now
removed by the <i>Turks</i>, which <i>Procopius</i> says was built by <i>Justinian</i>
in the <i>August&aelig;um</i>, and <i>Zonaras</i> in the Court before the Church of
<i>Sophia</i>, that the <i>August&aelig;um</i> stood where there is now a Fountain,
at the West End of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. <i>Suidas</i> says, that
<i>Justinian</i>, after he had built the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, cleansed
the Court, and paved it with Marble, and that it was formerly called
the <i>Forum August&aelig;um</i>; and adds, that he erected his own Statue there.
<i>Procopius</i> writes, <i>That there was a certain</i> Forum <i>facing the
Senate House, which was called by the Citizens the</i> August&aelig;um; <i>where
are seven Stones, so cemented together in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span> quadrangular Manner,
and are so contracted one within another the upper within the lower
Stone, that a Man may conveniently sit down upon every Projecture of
them</i>. I was more induced to give this Account from <i>Procopius</i>, of
the Pedestal, because I do not find it in his <i>printed Works</i>. Upon
the Top of it, says he, there’s erected a large Pillar, composed of
many Stones covered with Brass, which did at once both strengthen and
adorn them. The Plates of Brass did not reflect so strong a Lustre
as pure Gold, yet was it, in Value, little inferior to Silver. On
the Top of the Statue was set a large Horse in Brass, facing the
East, which indeed afforded a noble Prospect. He seemed to be in a
marching Posture, and struggling for Speed. His near Foot before was
curvated, as though he would paw the Ground; his off Foot was fixed
to the <i>Pedestal</i>, and his hind Feet were so contracted, as though he
was prepared to be gone. Upon the Horse was placed the Statue of the
Emperor. ’Twas made of Brass, large like a <i>Colossus</i>, dress’d in a
warlike Habit like <i>Achilles</i>, with Sandals on his Feet, and armed
with a Coat of Mail, and a shining Helmet. He looked Eastward, and
seemed to be marching against the <i>Persians</i>. In his left Hand he bore
a Globe, devised to signify his universal Power over the whole World.
On the Top of it was fixed a Cross, to which he attributed all his
Successes in War, and his Accession to the Imperial Dignity. His right
Hand was stretched to the East, and by pointing with his Fingers, he
seemed to forbid the barbarous Nations to approach nearer, but to stand
off at their Peril.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> <i>Tzetzes</i>, in his <i>Various History</i>, describes
what kind of Helmet he had upon his Head. <i>The</i> Persians, says he,
<i>generally wore a Turbant upon the Head. When the</i> Romans <i>obtained
any Victory over them, they plundered them of these Turbants, which
they placed upon their own Heads. They are</i>, says he, <i>of the same
Shape with that, with which the Statue of</i> Justinian, <i>erected upon a
large Pillar, is crowned</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> relates, that <i>Justinian</i> held
the Globe in his Silver Hand. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, that <i>Justinian</i>, in
the seventeenth Year of his Reign, set up this Pillar, in the same
Place, where formerly had stood another Pillar of <i>Theodosius</i> the
<i>Great</i>, bearing his Statue in Silver, made at the Expence of his Son
<i>Arcadius</i>, which weighed seven Thousand four Hundred Pounds. When
<i>Justinian</i> had demolished the Statue and the Pillar, he stripped it of
a vast Quantity of Lead, of which he made Pipes for <i>Aqueducts</i>, which
brought the Water into the City. This ill Treatment of <i>Theodosius</i>
by <i>Justinian</i>, was revenged upon him by the <i>Barbarians</i>; for they
used his Pillar in the same Manner, and stripped it of the Statue, the
Horse, and the Brass wherewith it was covered, so that it was only a
bare Column for some Years. About thirty Years ago the whole <i>Shaft</i>
was taken down to the <i>Pedestal</i>, and that, about a Year since, was
demolished down to the <i>Basis</i>, from whence I observed a Spring to
spout up with Pipes, into a large Cistern. At present there stands in
the same Place a Water-House, and the Pipes are enlarged. I lately
saw the <i>Equestrian</i> Statue of <i>Justinian</i>, erected upon the Pillar
which stood here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> which had been preserved a long Time in the
Imperial Precinct, carried into the melting Houses, where they cast
their Ordnance. Among the Fragments were the Leg of <i>Justinian</i>, which
exceeded my Height, and his Nose, which was above nine Inches long.
I dared not publickly measure the Horse’s Legs, as they lay upon the
Ground, but privately measured one of the Hoofs, and found it to be
nine Inches in Height. <i>Suidas</i>, and some modern Historians allure us,
that it was called the <i>Forum August&aelig;um</i>, because the <i>Curatores</i>,
and <i>Sebastophori</i>, on the fifteenth Day of <i>October</i>, used to dance
in the Market Place there, in Honour of <i>Augustus</i>; or because the
Statues of <i>Constantine</i>, and his Mother <i>Helena</i>, were set up in an
arched Gallery which stood here. <i>Zosimus</i>, a more antient Historian
than <i>Procopius</i>, asserts, that <i>Constantine</i> built a round Market,
with four <i>Portico</i>’s, two in a Row, above each other; and that he
roofed two of them with <i>Proconnesian</i> Marble, that you might pass from
them unto the Portico of <i>Severus</i>, and from thence beyond the Bounds
of the antient City; and adds, that this Market stood in a Place, to
which there was a Passage thro’ a Landgate adjacent. This is the same
Market which is intended by the <i>unknown Author</i> of the <i>History of
Constantinople</i>, where he tells us, that <i>Constantine</i> built a Market
in a circular Manner. The same Author tells us in another Place, that
when he was at <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Constantine</i> had surrounded the great
<i>Forum</i> with four <i>Portico</i>’s and placed at both Ends of one of them,
which you ascend by many Steps, two Statues: At one End<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> was placed
the Statue of <i>Rhea</i>, the Mother of the Gods, (the same Statue, which
those who sailed with <i>Jason</i>, placed on Mount <i>Dindymus</i>) rising above
the City of <i>Cyzicus</i>. They tell you, that for her Neglect in paying
divine Worship to the Gods, the Statue was defaced; and that her Hands,
which before held the Reins of two Lyons which stood before her, were
changed into a petitioning Posture. This Statue at the same Time faced
and adorned the City. At the other End of the <i>Portico</i> he placed the
<i>Fortune</i> of the City, though <i>Suidas</i> relates, that the <i>Fortune</i>
of the City stood in a Nich of the <i>Miliarium</i>. If this Statue was
set up here by <i>Constantine</i>, I should think, that both the Markets
mentioned by <i>Zosimus</i> are one and the same. But to me they seem to be
different; because <i>Zosimus</i> tells us in one Place, that <i>Constantine</i>
built a Market with two <i>Portico’s</i> round it, and afterwards, that
he built a Market with four <i>Portico</i>’s round it; unless he reckons
in the Account, the <i>Portico’s</i> of <i>Severus</i> and <i>Constantine</i>, from
whence there was a free Entrance into other <i>Portico’s</i>. On the East
Side of the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>, <i>Procopius</i> writes, that <i>Justinian</i>
built a large Court, where the Senate used to assemble, and celebrate
an Anniversary Festival every new Year. Before the Senate-House stand
six Columns, two of which support the Western Wall, in the Middle of
it. The other four stand at a little Distance from it. These Pillars
are all of white Marble, and I look upon them to be the largest in
the World. The other six support a <i>Portico</i>, which runs round the
Top of a large Building. The upper Part of the <i>Portico</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span> is adorned
with Marble elegantly variegated, and equal to that of the Columns,
and is furnished with an infinite Variety of curious Statues. I am
of Opinion, that <i>Justinian</i> did not build this <i>Senate-House</i>, but
that he rebuilt the old <i>Senate-House</i>, which was burnt down by the
Fire, which consumed the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and the Baths of
<i>Zeuxippus</i>. For <i>Sozomen</i> writes, that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>
built the Great Council-Hall, which was called the <i>Senate-House</i>, and
ordered it to be held in equal Dignity, and honoured it with the same
publick Celebration of the Feast of the <i>Calends</i>, with that of antient
<i>Rome</i>. He tells us where this great Court stood, when he writes, that
the silver Statue of <i>Eudoxia Augusta</i> was placed upon a <i>Porphyry</i>
Pillar, on the South Side of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, beyond the
high Pulpit, which faces the <i>Senate-House</i>. <i>Socrates</i> tells us, that
it was neither erected near, nor at any considerable Distance from the
Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>; but beyond the broad Way, as <i>Suidas</i> observes,
which runs between them both. <i>In the Tribunal of the Palace</i>, says he,
<i>stood the Pillar of</i> Eudoxia, <i>the Wife of</i> Theodosius. The Treatise
<i>of the antient Description of the Wards</i> places the Senate-House,
the <i>Tribunal</i> with <i>Porphyry</i> Steps, and the <i>Basilica</i>, all in
the same <i>Ward</i>. <i>Sozomen</i> clearly points out the Situation of the
<i>Senate-House</i>, where he says, that when a Tumult arose concerning the
Expulsion of St. <i>Chrysostom</i>, the great Church was all on a sudden in
a Blaze, which burnt down the Buildings upon the Walks, and the Great
<i>Senate-House</i>, lying to the South of them. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> some Remains of
the Walls of the <i>Senate-House</i> still standing, southerly of the Church
of St. <i>Sophia</i>, beyond the Way that leads from the Imperial Gate to
the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Imperial Palace, the</i> Basilica; <i>of the Palace of</i>
Constantine, <i>and the House of Entrance nam’d</i> Chalca.
</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">NOT far from the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>, as <i>Procopius</i> writes, stood a
Palace, the Statelyness and Magnificence of which the Reader may
easily guess at from the Description he gives of the <i>Vestibulum</i>,
or the House of Entrance into it. This <i>Vestibulum</i> is call’d the
<i>Chalca</i>, which is made after this Manner. There are four strait Walls
carried up to a great Height in a quadrangular Figure, from each
Angle of which there projects a Stone Building curiously finish’d,
which rises with the Wall from Top to Bottom, no ways intercepting
the beauteous Prospect before you, but seeming rather to add to the
Pleasure and Agreeableness of it. Above this Building are raised
eight Arches, supporting the Roof, which rises into a globular Height
most beautifully adorn’d. The Roof of it is not furnish’d with fine
Paintings, but shines with <i>Mosaick</i> Work of all sorts of Colours,
in the several Figures of Men, and other Kinds of Creatures. The
Historian at large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> has explain’d the Designs, which are the Scenes
of War, of Battles, and the Surrender of many Towns, both in <i>Africa</i>
and <i>Italy</i>. Among other Curiosities are describ’d the Victories of
<i>Justinian</i> under his General <i>Belisarius</i>, and his triumphant Return
to the Emperor. The Courage and Chearfulness of his Army is expressed
in a lively Manner. The General is figured in an humble Posture, as
making an Offering to him of all the Kings, the Kingdoms, and other
rich Spoils he had taken from the Enemy. In the Middle of the Work
is represented the Emperor and his Empress <i>Theodora</i> in a pleasant
gay Humour, celebrating a Festival in Honour of his Victory over
the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i>, and bringing great Numbers of Captives
before him. The whole Senate is described round them, joining in the
Celebration. They all look chearful and merry, smiling, and highly
pleased with the Honour they have to attend the Emperor on so important
an Occasion. I would here observe, that as <i>Papinius</i> in his <i>Sylv&aelig;</i>
calls the <i>Basilica</i> of <i>Paulus</i>, the Palace of <i>Paulus</i>, so the
House, which <i>Procopius</i> calls <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βασιλεῖον</span> went by the Name
both of the <i>Basilica</i> and the Palace. And I am confirm’d in this
Opinion from <i>Cedrinus</i>, who says, That the Fire which happen’d in
the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, burnt down the Porch, or House of Entrance
into the <i>Basilica</i>, the <i>Basilica</i> itself, and the brazen Covering
of the Palace of <i>Constantine the Great</i>, which from that Time to
this Day, is call’d the <i>Chalca</i>, because it is cover’d with Plates
of Brass gilded. What <i>Cedrinus</i> calls the <i>Basilica</i>, <i>Procopius</i>,
in his Book <i>De &AElig;dif. Justiniani</i>, calls <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ Βασιλεῖα</span>, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
speaking of the Fire above-mention’d, he tells us, That it consumed
the Gate-houses <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῶν Βασιλείων</span>, and that in particular which
was call’d <i>Chalca</i>: The same Writer adds a little lower, that the
Emperor commanded <i>Belisarius</i> to go to the <i>Chalca</i>, and the other
Houses of Entrance seated by it. From which Words it is observable,
that <i>Procopius</i> seems to believe, that there were other Houses of
Entrance into the Palace, though in the Beginning of this Chapter he
mentions only the <i>Chalca</i>. It is my Opinion, that the House where
the Emperor dwelt was first call’d the <i>Basilica</i>; that afterwards,
when the great Houses, where the Merchants assembled for Trade and
Commerce, were call’d <i>Basilica</i>, the Emperor’s House was call’d
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βασιλεῖον</span>; and, at last, the Palace. If there was any
Difference between the <i>Basilica</i> and the Palace, yet the <i>Basilica</i>
was either a part of the Palace, or built near to it, as the Reader
may see in the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i>, which places the
<i>Augusteum</i> and the <i>Basilica</i> in the same <i>Ward</i>. As this <i>Treatise</i>
takes no Notice in this <i>Ward</i> either of a Palace or a Court, but
only of a <i>Basilica</i>, it seems to intimate, that the <i>Basilica</i> was
the Palace itself. But whether the <i>Basilica</i> was within or without
the Palace, it is certain it was near it, because they were both
destroy’d by Fire, by reason of their Vicinity to one another; and the
Rules of <i>Architecture</i> prescribe, that it be built near a Market,
which is always near the Palace; and that it be built warm, that the
Merchants may manage their Business there in Winter Time, without any
Molestation from the Severity of the Weather. <i>Julius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span> Pollux</i> is of
the same Opinion, who says, That the <i>Stadia</i>, the <i>Hippodrom</i>, the
<i>Senate-House</i>, the <i>Forum</i>, the Court, the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, and the
<i>Tribunal</i>, ought to stand near the Theatre. <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, that
the beautiful Structure of the <i>Chalca</i> was built by one <i>&AElig;therius</i> a
famous Architect, by the Command of the wife of Emperor <i>Anastasius</i>,
as appears from a <i>Greek</i> Inscription upon it, which runs thus:</p>

<p class="noindent">Some modern Historians will have it, that <i>Constantine the Great</i> first
built the Palace of <i>Chalca</i>. I should be inclinable to disbelieve
them, but that I am induced to think it was so, when I observ’d the
brazen Tyles gilded with Gold, resembling those of the <i>Capitol</i>,
and a <i>Forum</i> of <i>Old Rome</i>, whose Buildings <i>Constantine</i> was proud
to imitate, as near as he could. I could never learn, who it was who
remov’d the Tyles of the <i>Chalca</i>; though it is not improbable, but
that they were spoiled by the Fire. ’Tis related by <i>Procopius</i>, that
<i>Genseric</i> plunder’d half the <i>Roman</i> Capitol of the gilded Plates of
Brass that cover’d it, and that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Third</i>, the Nephew
of <i>Heraclius</i>, carry’d off the Silver Plates which were laid over the
<i>Pantheon</i>. At a small Distance (on the South-west Side of the Church
of St. <i>Sophia</i>) from the Water-Pipes of an <i>Aqueduct</i> running from a
Conduit situate in the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>, where was erected the Pillar
of <i>Justinian</i>, are still remaining seven <i>Corinthian</i> Pillars, on the
<i>Shaft</i> of one of which is cut the Name of <i>Constantine</i>, with the
<i>Signal</i> of the Cross he saw in the Heavens, with this Inscription,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν τούτῳ νίκα</span>. The <i>Basis</i> and <i>Shaft</i> of these Pillars are
buried, at the Bottom of them, under Ground, to the Depth of six Foot,
which I discover’d, when I casually fell into the Foundation of the
Walls, which were built between them. I could not see the <i>Plinth</i> of
the <i>Base</i> of any of them, because it was cover’d with Earth; yet I
perceiv’d the lowermost <i>Tore</i>, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span> eight Digits in Thickness,
and seven in Height. The Stone at the Bottom of the <i>Shaft</i> was nine
Inches broad. Every Pillar is thirty Foot and six Digits high: In
short, the whole <i>Pillar</i>, <i>Capital</i> and <i>Pedestal</i>, is about forty six
Foot and a half in Height. The Bottom of the <i>Shaft</i>, which I measured
just above the Stone it bears upon, is eighteen Foot in Circumference.
The Pillars stand at the Distance of twenty Foot and ten Digits from
each other. The Inhabitants say, that these Pillars stood within the
Palace of <i>Constantine</i>; others say, that they formerly supported a
Bridge, over which you passed, as you went from the Palace to the
Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. But there is nothing of Truth in either of
these Opinions; for ’tis plain from what I observed before, that they
stood in the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>. So that I am inclined to believe, that
they supported the Arches of the <i>Portico’s</i>, in which the Statues of
<i>Constantine the Great</i>, his Mother <i>Helena</i>, and other Statues were
placed. From what I have said, the Reader may trace the Beauty and
Grandeur of the Palaces at <i>Constantinople</i>, as well as from <i>Zosimus</i>,
who says, that <i>Constantine</i> built some Palaces at <i>Constantinople</i>,
little inferior to those of <i>Rome</i>. <i>Eusebius</i> reports, that he
illustrated and adorn’d <i>New Rome</i>, and the Imperial Palace, in other
respects, besides those I have mention’d, but that in the finest
Buildings of his Palace, and in the Middle of all his gilded Roofs, he
fix’d a Cross set with several Kinds of the richest Jewels, shining
with massy Gold; intimating thereby, that he look’d upon the Cross as
the Defence and Bulwark of his Government. St. <i>Jerome</i> tells us, <i>That
he stripp’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span> almost every City of its Curiosities and Ornaments,
to adorn his New</i> Rome. <i>Eusebius</i> also mentions the Statues of the
<i>Muses</i>, which he caused to be fix’d up in his Palace. <i>Sozomen</i>
writes, that by the Command of <i>Constantine</i>, all that was valuable in
the Temples of the Ancients under his Government, and all the brazen
Statues of the nicest Workmanship were brought to <i>Constantinople</i>, to
beautify the City; which, he tells us, remain’d in the publick <i>Ways</i>,
in the <i>Hippodrom</i>, and in the Palace, down to his Time. But not only
<i>Constantine the Great</i>, but many other Emperors of <i>Constantinople</i>
ravaged the whole World for the Decoration of this City. Among these
was <i>Constantine the Third</i>, the Nephew of <i>Heraclius</i>, who plunder’d
<i>ancient Rome</i> of all its brazen and Marble Statues, ship’d off all
the costly Furniture of their Temples, and made more Havock there in
the Space of seven Days, than the <i>barbarous</i> Nations did in the Space
of two hundred and fifty Years; for so many Years was the <i>Roman</i>
Empire in its Declension before that general Pillage. <i>Iornandes</i>, no
indifferent Writer of the <i>Getick</i> History, reports, That <i>Theodorick
Prefect</i> of <i>Constantinople</i> was adopted, and made Consul by the
Emperor <i>Zeno</i>, who honour’d him with an <i>Equestrian</i> Statue, which was
erected before the Palace. <i>Tzetzes</i>, in his <i>various History</i>, tells
us, that even in his Time, the Head of <i>Apollo</i>, made by <i>Phidias</i> in
the Likeness of the Sun, remain’d in the Palace. <i>Suidas</i> relates, that
the Statue of <i>Pulcheria</i>, the Daughter of <i>Arcadius</i>, was placed in
the <i>Chalca</i>, near the Walks of <i>Ariadne</i> the first Wife of <i>Zeno</i>,
and that the Statues of <i>Zeno</i> himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span> were set up in the Imperial
Gate-house of <i>Chalca</i>; as were also two other Statues on foot, erected
upon a small Pillar, with Elegies inscrib’d upon them, composed by
<i>Secundus</i> the Philosopher. I have seen in the History of no creditable
Author, tho’ well known to the People of <i>Constantinople</i>, that
<i>Justinian</i> erected on the left Side of the <i>Chalca</i>, seven Statues in
Honour of his Relations, some of Brass, and some of Marble, and that
he had also set up two Horses in the Nich before the <i>Chalca</i>, as also
some gilded Heads of Women, in the frightful Likeness of <i>Medusa</i>; I
could mention others, but that I do not much depend upon the Authority
of the History. <i>Suidas</i> says, that in the <i>Tribunal</i> of the Palace
stood the Statues of <i>Eudoxia</i>, and her Emperor <i>Theodosius</i>; of
<i>Marcian</i> and <i>Constantine</i>, till the Time of <i>Heraclius</i>.</p>

and his Sons <i>Biopalus</i> and <i>Anthermus</i>. <i>Dionysius</i>, a Native of
<i>Byzantium</i> writes, that <i>Byzas</i>, from whom <i>Byzantium</i> took its Name,
was the Husband of <i>Phidalia</i>, from whom the Port of the <i>Bosporus</i>
took the Name of the Port of <i>Phidalia</i>, of which I have wrote more
largely in my <i>Treatise of the Bosporus</i>. <i>Suidas</i>, and some modern
Writers say, that in the <i>Basilica</i>, behind the <i>Miliarium Aureum</i>,
there was a gilded Statue in the Likeness of a Man, where was also the
<i>Exammon</i> of <i>Heraclius</i>, and the Statue of <i>Justin</i> the Emperor in
a kneeling Posture. <i>Terbelis</i> is said to have preached in the same
Place. Here was also placed by the Order of <i>Severus</i>, the Figure
of a large Elephant, upon the following Occasion:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span> That an Elephant
being stabled near it, and the House of a Silver-Smith, who worked
in Plate, being robbed, he suspecting the Keeper of the Elephant to
be the Thief, threatned him with Death, unless he would move his
Station; and the Fellow bidding him Defiance, he slew him, and threw
him to the Elephant, at which the Beast being enraged, killed his
Keeper’s Murderer. <i>Severus</i> being acquainted with the Fact, offered
Sacrifices to the Elephant, commanded him and his Keeper to be cast
in Brass, and set up here; where also, as <i>Suidas</i> relates, was the
Statue of <i>Hercules</i>, to which the <i>Byzantians</i> paid divine Adoration,
and offered Sacrifice. Afterwards, in the <i>Consulship</i> of <i>Julian</i>,
it was moved into the <i>Hippodrom</i>; but was originally, with ten other
Statues, brought from <i>Old Rome</i>, partly by Sea, and partly by Land
Carriage. Thus it was that <i>Hercules</i>, living and dead, travelled the
greatest Part of the World. <i>Suidas</i> writes, that in the Imperial
Walks were placed the <i>Equestrian</i> Statues of <i>Trajan</i>, <i>Theodosius</i>,
<i>Valentinian</i>, <i>Gibbus</i>, and <i>Firmillianus</i> the Buffoon. There were
many other Statues of Emperors and Eunuchs set up in this Place, the
most famous of which was the Statue of <i>Eutropius</i>, who was Chamberlain
to the Emperor <i>Arcadius</i>. The Honour and Opulency of this Eunuch
appeared in numberless gilded Statues, erected to him in every Part
of the City, and the Magnificence and Superiority of the Houses he
built, almost in every Street. This so far encouraged and increased the
Number of the Eunuchs, that even the Boys affected to be so, that they
might become as rich and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> honourable as <i>Eutropius</i>. The <i>Basilica</i>
was so near to the <i>Miliarium</i>, and the <i>Augusteum</i>, that the Clock
made by the Command of the Emperor <i>Justin</i>, <i>Cedrinus</i> places in
the <i>Miliarium</i>, others in the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>, and others in the
<i>Basilica</i>, as is evident from the following Inscription.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Imperial Library, and</i> Portico;
<i>as also of the Imperial</i> Cistern.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Imperial Palace, says <i>Zonaras</i>, stood near the <i>Basilica</i>,
hard by the Brasiers Shops. The <i>Basilica</i> was furnished with many
Volumes, both of human and divine Learning. It was anciently the
Mansion House of some Person of distinguished Knowledge, whom they
called the President or Master. He had under him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span> twelve Assistants,
excellently well skilled in the Art of Reasoning, who were maintained
at the publick Charge. They had each of them several Pupils under
them, who were instructed in the Methods of Argumentation, and were
had in such high Estimation, that upon all important Affairs of State,
the Emperors summoned them to Council. In the Reign of <i>Basilicus</i>,
there happened at <i>Constantinople</i> a great Fire, which begun at, and
consumed the Brasiers Shops, with all the adjacent Buildings, burnt
down whole Streets; and among other fine Edifices, destroyed the famous
<i>Basilica</i>, which contained a Library of six hundred thousand Volumes.
Among other Curiosities of this Place, was the Gut of a Dragon, a
hundred and twenty Foot long, on which were inscribed in Golden
Characters the <i>Iliads</i> and <i>Odysses</i> of <i>Homer</i>. <i>Malchus</i>, a learned
<i>Byzantian</i>, wrote the History of <i>Constantinople</i>, which he brought
down from the Reign of <i>Constantine</i>, to the Time of <i>Anastasius</i>
the Emperor, in which he very passionately laments the burning of
the publick Library, and the Statues of the <i>Forum Augusteum</i>.
<i>Cedrinus</i> speaking of the same Library, gives the same Account of it
with <i>Zonaras</i>, almost word for word, and adds, <i>That this Library
contain’d the Histories of the Atchievements of the greatest Heroes, in
the several Ages of the World</i>. Many Years after this <i>Basilica</i> was
burn’d down, the Emperor <i>Leo Conon</i>, the Students vigorously opposing
his Heresy, order’d the Palace to be fired, and burnt them, and the
Library; which was afterwards rebuilt, and furnished with a most
curious Collection of the best Authors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span> The <i>Basilic&aelig;</i> at <i>Old Rome</i>,
were the Places where they used to plead, to hold their Councils and
<i>Senates</i>, and to carry on the Business of Merchandize and Commerce: At
<i>Constantinople</i> they were used as Libraries and Schools of Learning,
as appears by what I have already observ’d, as also from the following
Inscription.</p>

<p class="center">Upon the publick School in <i>Byzantium</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>This Place was built for all th’ unletter’d Youth</i></div>

<div class="line"><i>In Pleading skill’d, and fraught with Eloquence</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>They leave these Walls, and plead their Countrey’s Cause.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">Modern Writers tell us, that the Place where the Library stood was of
an Octogonal Figure, where there were arch’d <i>Portico’s</i>, and a large
Room, where the head Master used to converse with his Assistants.
<i>Cedrinus</i> affirms, that the great Church, the Hospital of <i>Sampson</i>,
the Gate-house of the <i>Basilica</i>, the <i>Augusteum</i>, the <i>Chalca</i>, the
two long <i>Portico’s</i>, as far as the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, the
<i>Octogon</i>, and the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Zeuxippus</i>, were destroy’d by a
Fire, which happen’d in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>. I would observe
from this Passage, that there must of Necessity be two <i>Octogons</i>
near one another. For if the <i>Octogon</i>, as <i>Cedrinus</i> reports, had
been the same with that where the Library stood, he would not have
omitted to take Notice that the Library was burnt down also in the
Reign of <i>Justinian</i>. It is my Opinion, that the Place where the
Library stood, was of a quadrangular Figure, and seems to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span> the
same Building which <i>Procopius</i> says was encompassed with Pillars
erected in a square Manner. <i>Zonaras</i> mentions nothing of the Form of
the <i>Basilica</i>, which contain’d the Library, but only says, that it
adjoin’d to the <i>Chalcopratia</i>, or Braziers Shops. <i>Cedrinus</i> calls
the <i>Basilica</i>, <i>Cisterna</i>, which some Writers erroneously tell us,
was built by <i>Constantine the Great</i>. I am confirm’d in this Opinion
from <i>Procopius</i>, who says, that near the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, where
the Lawyers used to plead, there was a spacious Building of a great
Length and Breadth, encompassed with Pillars in a quadrangular Manner,
situate on a rocky Ground, which was built by <i>Justinian</i> to a great
Height, for preserving the Water in Summer, which was brought into it
by subterraneous Pipes, and in the Winter from the <i>Aqueducts</i>, for
the Use of the Poor. <i>Menander</i>, surnam’d the <i>Protector</i>, says of
himself, that it was once against his Inclinations to enter into the
Litigations of the Law in the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, and by the Force of
Pleading, to attempt to reconcile the Jarrings and Contentions of Men.
<i>Agathius</i> plays handsomly upon one <i>Uranius</i> a Native of <i>Syria</i>,
who set up for a Physician, although he was entirely ignorant of the
<i>Aristotelian</i> Discipline. This Fellow was blustering, noisy, an
impudent Pretender to infallible Cures, and very talkative, among other
Places, in the Imperial <i>Portico</i>; and speaking of himself, he tells
us, that he has often from Morning to Night read over many Law Books,
and Discourses of Trade and Commerce in the Imperial <i>Portico</i>’s. From
these Passages it is observable, that the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, and the
Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> <i>Cistern</i>, stood in the same Place. The Imperial <i>Portico</i>
is not to be seen, though the <i>Cistern</i> is still remaining. Through
the Carelesness and Contempt of every thing that is curious in the
Inhabitants, it was never discover’d, but by me, who was a Stranger
among them, after a long and diligent Search after it. The whole Ground
was built upon, which made it less suspected there was a <i>Cistern</i>
there. The People had not the least Suspicion of it, although they
daily drew their Water out of the Wells which were sunk into it. I went
by Chance into a House, where there was a Descent into it, and went
aboard a little Skiff. The Master of the House, after having lighted
some Torches, rowing me here and there across, through the Pillars,
which lay very deep in Water, I made a Discovery of it. He was very
intent upon catching his Fish, with which the <i>Cistern</i> abounds, and
spear’d some of them by the Light of the Torches. There is also a small
Light which descends from the Mouth of the Well, and reflects upon the
Water, where the Fish usually come for Air. This <i>Cistern</i> is three
hundred and thirty six Foot long, a hundred and eighty two Foot broad,
and two hundred and twenty four <i>Roman</i> Paces in Compass. The Roof, and
Arches, and Sides, are all Brick-work, and cover’d with Terrass, which
is not the least impair’d by Time. The Roof is supported with three
hundred and thirty six Marble Pillars. The Space of <i>Intercolumniation</i>
is twelve Foot. Each Pillar is above forty Foot nine Inches high.
They stand lengthways in twelve Ranges, broad-ways in twenty eight.
The <i>Capitals</i> of them are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span> partly finish’d after the <i>Corinthian</i>
Model, and part of them not finish’d. Over the <i>Abacus</i> of every Pillar
is placed a large Stone, which seems to be another <i>Abacus</i>, and
supports four Arches. There are abundance of Wells which fall into the
<i>Cistern</i>. I have seen, when it was filling in the Winter-time, a large
Stream of Water falling from a great Pipe with a mighty Noise, till the
Pillars, up to the Middle of the <i>Capitals</i>, have been cover’d with
Water. This <i>Cistern</i> stands Westward of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, at
the Distance of eighty <i>Roman</i> Paces from it.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the</i> Chalcopratia.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">IT is plain from what has been observed, that the <i>Chalcopratia</i>,
or Places where they work’d their Brass, stood near the <i>Basilica</i>.
<i>Cedrinus</i> reports, That <i>Theodosius the Less</i> built the Church of the
<i>Chalcopratia</i>, and dedicated it to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>. Others say,
that the <i>Jews</i>, who had lived there from the Time of <i>Constantine the
Great</i>, had obliged <i>Theodosius the Less</i> to retire from thence, and
built that Church; and that afterwards, when it had been shatter’d by
an Earthquake, it was rebuilt by <i>Justin Curopalatos</i>, tho’ <i>Zonaras</i>
is of another Opinion. <i>Theodosius the Great</i>, says he, <i>marching into
the Western Parts, the</i> Jews <i>took the Opportunity, and made</i> Honoratus
<i>the Prefect of the City, their Friend, and obtain’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span> of him the
Freedom to build a Synagogue in the</i> Chalcopratia: <i>The People being
enraged at this, set it on fire, and burnt it down. When</i> Theodosius
<i>was made acquainted with the Fact, he lay’d a Fine upon those who were
concern’d in it, and gave them a fresh Licence to build another. St.</i>
Ambrose, <i>who was then Bishop of</i> Milan, <i>being inform’d of the Matter,
lay’d before</i> Theodosius <i>the Greatness of the Crime, in suffering the</i>
Jews <i>to build a Synagogue in the very Centre of the Queen of Cities,
upon which he remitted the Fine, and stopp’d their Proceedings</i>.
There are no Braziers Shops in this Place at present, they being
removed into another part of the City, tho’ I was inform’d by some
of the Inhabitants, that not many Years since they follow’d their
Trade near the <i>Chalcopratia</i>. The <i>unknown Author</i> of the History of
<i>Constantinople</i>, describing the Boundaries of <i>Old Byzantium</i>, tells
us, <i>That the</i> Chalcopratia <i>were not far from the</i> Miliarium. Others
say, that they were near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. <i>Strabo</i> speaking
of the Palace of <i>Alexandria</i>, relates, that in Conformity to this at
<i>Constantinople</i>, it had a Library, a <i>Portico</i>, a Convocation-House,
or Place of Assembly upon publick Affairs, and a large publick
Foundation for the Encouragement of Persons of Literature and Science.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the</i> Portico’s <i>situate between the Palace,
and the</i> Forum <i>of</i> Constantine.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">BESIDES the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, which stood near the Library, there
were also other <i>Portico’s</i> at a little Distance from it, which reach’d
from the Palace to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. The first Fire, which
happen’d in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, consumed the Palace and the
Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, both the long <i>Portico</i>’s, as far as the <i>Forum
of Constantine</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> says, that besides these, it destroy’d also
the <i>Chalca</i> and the <i>Augusteum</i>. The Fire that happen’d afterwards
in the Reign of <i>Basiliscus</i>, began at the <i>Chalcopratia</i>, burnt down
the two adjoining <i>Portico’s</i>, all the neighbouring Buildings, the
<i>Basilica</i>, in which was the Library, two <i>Portico’s</i> which stood
between the Palaces, and all the fine Ornaments of the <i>Lausus</i>. These
<i>Portico’s</i> have been often burnt, and as often rebuilt; first of
all by <i>Justinian</i>, then by others, and last by <i>Domninus</i>, which is
confirm’d by a modern Historian, who says, That when <i>Constantinople</i>
was taken by the <i>Gauls</i> and the <i>Venetians</i>, the cover’d <i>Portico</i>’s
of <i>Domninus</i> reaching on both Sides of the Way, from the <i>Miliarium</i>
to the Forum of <i>Constantine</i>, were burnt to the Ground. Some say,
That in the Time of <i>Constantine the Great</i>, <i>Eubulus</i> built four
double <i>Portico’s</i>, which were arch’d at Top, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span> reach’d from the
Palace to the Land Wall of the City; one of which stretch’d as far
as the Church of St. <i>Anthony</i>, at the End of the City, another from
the Port of <i>Sophia</i>, to the Church named <i>Rabdon</i>; the other two
extended themselves from the <i>Chalca</i>, and the <i>Miliarium</i> to the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, the Street call’d <i>Taurus</i>, and the <i>Brazen
Bull</i>. All of them were paved with square Marble, and adorn’d with
infinite Numbers of Statues. These Relations, though they come from
unknown Authors, who, as I have sometimes observed, have not so
strictly adhered to Truth, yet seem to carry with them a good Face of
Probability, since it is evident from Historians of more Veracity, how
industrious <i>Constantine</i> was in adorning the City; and ’tis no less
evident from the <i>Treatise of the ancient Description of the Wards</i>,
that <i>Constantinople</i>, in the Reigns of <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Honorius</i>,
had no less than fifty two publick <i>Portico’s</i>, five of which the
Author places in the fourth <i>Ward</i>, in which stood the <i>Basilica</i>,
the Imperial <i>Portico</i>, and the <i>Portico</i> of <i>Fannio</i>; besides which,
he places four large <i>Portico’s</i> in the sixth <i>Ward</i>. In the same
<i>Ward</i> he places another large <i>Portico</i>. He adds, that the seventh
<i>Ward</i> abounds with <i>Portico’s</i>, and that the eighth <i>Ward</i> had six
<i>Portico’s</i> more. In the ninth <i>Ward</i> were two large <i>Portico’s</i>. The
tenth had six, the eleventh four. From which it is credible, that the
<i>Portico’s</i> stood very thick from the <i>Chalca</i> to the Land Wall, but I
cannot say they were contiguous beyond the <i>Taurus</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the</i> Miliarium Aureum <i>and its Statues,
and of the</i> Fortune <i>of the City,
and her Statue</i>.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Miliarium Aureum</i> was a gilded Pillar, from whence they used
to adjust the Mensuration of their Miles, and the Distances from
the City. <i>Pliny</i> tells us, that it was set up at <i>Rome</i> in the
highest Ground of the publick <i>Forum</i>; but whether the <i>Miliarium</i> at
<i>Constantinople</i> was like that of <i>Rome</i>, the <i>Greek</i> Historians have
been so far from declaring their Opinions concerning it, that in all
their Writings they have not so much as mention’d the Name of it. Yet
it seems very probable to me, that it was like it, and was also seated
in the <i>Forum</i>, or near it. For the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i>
places it in the <i>Ward</i> where the <i>Forum Augusteum</i> and the <i>Basilica</i>
stood, to which it adjoin’d. They who have written the History of
the Atchievements of <i>Alexius Comnenus</i> the Emperor, tell us, that
at Break of Day, the Forces of <i>Alexius</i>, marching out of the great
Palace, under the Command of <i>Sabatius</i> their General, enter’d the
Church of St. <i>John</i> the <i>Divine</i>, and when they had got to the Top of
the Church, they express’d themselves in a provoking manner, so that a
Battle began about three in the Morning, and that many People in the
<i>Forum</i> were wounded, who fought from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> Roof of the <i>Miliarium</i>, and
the Top of St. <i>John</i>’s Church. The Inhabitants say, that this was the
Church where the Elephants of the <i>Grand Seignor</i> are now stabled. ’Tis
near the <i>Hippodrom</i>, and the <i>Forum Cupedinis</i>, famous for Niceties,
situate near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and was formerly called the
<i>Forum Augusteum</i>. But to come closer to the Point: <i>Suidas</i> says,
<i>That in the</i> Basilica, <i>behind the</i> Miliarium, <i>were placed a gilded
Statue of a Man, as also of an Elephant and his Keeper</i>; others, with
more Probability, say, that these Statues were erected behind the
<i>Basilica</i>, near the <i>Miliarium</i>. <i>Suidas</i> adds, that the Statue of
<i>Theodosius</i> was placed in the <i>Miliarium</i>, and that upon the setting
it up, he distributed large Donations of Corn among the People. Upon
the <i>Equestrian</i> Statue of <i>Theodosius</i>, not remaining at present, were
inscrib’d these Verses.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line"><i>Not the bright Sun, which gilds the Eastern Sky</i>,</div>

<div class="line"><i>The fiery Steed, pleas’d with the Royal Burthen</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>In warlike Posture seems to move, and live.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Suidas</i> proceeds farther, and tells us, that the Statues of <i>Sophia</i>,
the Consort of <i>Justin</i> the <i>Thracian</i>, of his Daughter <i>Arabia</i>, and
his Niece <i>Helena</i>; as also the <i>Equestrian</i> Statues of <i>Arcadius</i> and
<i>Theodosius</i> his Son, were placed in the <i>Miliarium</i>, near the Statue
of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, that there stood two
Statues above the Nich of the <i>Miliarium</i>, one of <i>Constantine</i> the
<i>Great</i>, the other of his Mother <i>Helena</i>, with a Cross between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span> them:
Behind them was placed the Statue of <i>Trajan</i> on Horse-back, and that
near him was placed the Statue of <i>&AElig;lius Hadrianus</i>. <i>Suidas</i> adds,
that the Cross which was placed between <i>Constantine</i> and <i>Helena</i>, had
this Inscription; <i>una sancta, &amp; duo celeres Cursores</i>. From whence it
is evident, that the <i>Forum</i>, the <i>Miliarium</i>, and the <i>Basilica</i> stood
so near together, that they are not only placed by different Authors
in different Places, but sometimes by one and the same Historian.
The same Writer says, that there was also in the <i>Miliarium</i> a great
Piece of Antiquity, which was a Chariot drawn by four Fallow Horses,
supported by two square Pillars, in the Place where <i>Constantine</i>
was received by his Army with joyful Congratulations, after he had
conquered <i>Azotium</i>; but originally, because <i>Byzas</i>, the Founder of
<i>Byzantium</i>, had there been highly applauded by the People. The Chariot
of the Sun was carried into the <i>Hippodrom</i>, in which was seated a
small Statue, made by the Order of <i>Constantine</i>. This Statue was the
<i>Fortune</i> of the City, which on great Festivals, and the Day of the
Celebration of the Foundation of the City, was set up with a Cross on
her Head, in the <i>Senate-House</i>. <i>Julian</i> the Apostate demolished it
in the same Place, where <i>Arius</i> died in a miserable Manner, which
was at a small Distance from the <i>Senate-House</i>. In the same Place,
the pious Emperor <i>Theodosius</i> had ordered the Statues of <i>Arius</i>,
<i>Macedonius</i>, <i>Sabellius</i>, and <i>Eunomius</i>, which were cut in Marble,
to be placed in a sitting Posture on the Ground, to be polluted with
the Excrements, and receive the Curses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span> People, in Token of
their flagrant Perfidiousness. Other Historians say, that the Statue
of the <i>Fortune</i> of the City was brought from <i>Rome</i> by <i>Constantine</i>
the <i>Great</i>, and placed in a Nich in the Palace. <i>Zosimus</i> writes, that
<i>Constantine</i> placed the <i>Fortune</i> of <i>Rome</i>, on the Side of one of the
four <i>Portico’s</i> that surrounded the great <i>Forum</i>. ’Tis very probable,
that the People of <i>Constantinople</i> celebrated a Festival in Honour of
her, as was customary at <i>Old Rome</i>, both by Natives and Foreigners,
the same Day, in which the <i>Palilia</i>, (the Festivals of <i>Pales</i>) were
celebrated. <i>Socrates</i> tells us, that <i>Julian</i>, when he was publickly
sacrificing to the <i>Fortune</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, in the <i>Basilica</i>,
where her Statue was set up; <i>Mares</i>, the Bishop of <i>Chalcedon</i>, being
led thither by the Hand, for he was blind with Age, sharply reprimanded
him, and called him an Apostate from the Christian Religion. <i>Julian</i>
in Return, called him a blind old Fellow, adding sarcastically this
Question; <i>Is your God, the Galilean, able to cure you?</i> For thus, by
Way of Contempt, he used to call our Saviour. Upon which the good old
Bishop replied, <i>I thank my God, who has taken my Sight from me, so
that I cannot behold the Man who is fallen into so great an Apostacy</i>;
upon which <i>Julian</i> was silent. <i>Zonaras</i>, and some Historians who
lived before him, have recorded, That in the Time of <i>Anastasius</i>, the
Statue of <i>Fortune</i>, made in Brass, stood with one Foot in a brazen
Ship, and was placed in some Part of the City; but that when this Ship
began to decay with Age, or some Parts of it were stolen, or shattered
by Treachery, it happened, that no Ships of Burthen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> came into the
Port of <i>Constantinople</i>, but that upon their Arrival near the City,
a Storm prevented their coming into Harbour; and if their Cargo was
taken aboard the Long-boats, and brought into the City, they tell you
it was soon consumed, by Reason of the Scarcity, which then prevailed.
Upon this, the <i>Curatores</i> of the City were obliged to enquire into
the Reason of it. When the Magistrates of the City, upon Information,
began to suspect the Cause, they found, upon Enquiry, the Fragments
of the Ship, which were fitted to their proper Places, when on a
sudden, Navigation was open and free, and the Sea was constantly full
of Vessels sailing into the Port. And that they might fully discover
the real Cause of this Calamity, they repeated the Experiment, by
stripping the Ship again of some Pieces of it, and the Ships coming
into Harbour, were prevented as before; so they repaired the brazen
Vessel she stood in, and took a particular Care of it. <i>Eunapius</i>, who
wrote the <i>History of the Lives of the Philosophers and wise Men</i>,
says, that in the Reign of <i>Constantine</i>, the Inhabitants attributed
this Difficulty of coming into Harbour to another Cause. <i>There was no
entring the Port at</i> Constantinople, says he, <i>unless the Wind stood
full South. When this had frequently happened, the People, oppressed
with Famine, assembled in the Theatre, enraged at</i> Constantine. <i>The
Chief of the Courtiers having conceived a Resentment against</i> Sopatrus
<i>the Philosopher, brought him before the Emperor, and impeached him
in the following Manner: This</i> Sopatrus, <i>Sir, who is so high in your
Favour, has by his excessive Wisdom chained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> up the Winds, for which
you so far admire him, as to admit him too near your Imperial Person</i>.
<i>Constantine</i>, believing the Allegations, ordered him to be beheaded.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">I Cannot omit taking Notice of the Church of St. <i>Mina</i>, because it
shews in what Part of the City the fourth <i>Ward</i> stood, which contained
the <i>Basilica</i>, the <i>Augusteum</i>, and the Church of St. <i>Mina</i>. The
History of an unknown Author reports, that <i>Byzas</i> formerly built a
Temple to <i>Neptune</i>, near the <i>Acropolis</i>, by the Sea, where, he says,
that in his Time stood the Church of St. <i>Mina</i> the Martyr; though he
seems to contradict himself, where he says, that the Church of St.
<i>Mina</i> was formerly the Temple of <i>Jupiter</i>, and that the Roof of it,
which was arched with Marble, was supported with two large Pillars.
So that I can conclude nothing from the Uncertainty of this Writer,
but that it seems more probable to me, that the Church of St. <i>Mina</i>
stood in those Parts of the <i>Acropolis</i>, in which formerly stood the
Temple of <i>Neptune</i>, as appears from <i>Dionysius</i> an antient Writer of
<i>Byzantium</i>, who says, that a little above the <i>Promontory</i> of the
<i>Bosporus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> was erected an Altar to <i>Minerva Egressoria</i>, and the
Temple of <i>Neptune</i>; and that below the Temple of <i>Neptune</i> were the
<i>Stadia</i>, and the <i>Gymnasia</i>, where they diverted themselves with
martial Sports and Exercises, as I have shewn more at large in my
Treatise of the <i>Bosporus</i>. I am confirmed in this Opinion from the
Information of some of the Inhabitants now living, who told me, that
within the Imperial Precinct, formerly called the <i>Acropolis</i>, stood
the Church of St. <i>Mina</i>. The <i>Antient Description of the Wards of the
City</i> tells us, that the Church of St. <i>Mina</i> stood in the same Ward
with the <i>Stadia</i>, and the Stairs of <i>Timasius</i>. <i>Procopius</i> writes,
<i>That at the Place called the</i> Stadium, <i>near the Sea, where they
exercised themselves in martial Sports, the Emperor</i> Justinian, <i>and
his Empress</i> Theodora, <i>built some large Inns for the Entertainment of

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Lausus</i> is a Place celebrated in the Writings of many Historians,
some of whom write, that it was the House of <i>Lausus</i> a Patrician, who
bore many Offices in the Reign of <i>Arcadius</i>, the Son of <i>Theodosius</i>
the <i>Great</i>, and that he adorned his House with many famous Monuments
of Antiquity. There is a Book still extant, under the Title of
<i>Lausaicus</i>, which was wrote by <i>Heraclidas</i>, Bishop of <i>Cappadocia</i>,
and inscribed to <i>Lausus</i>. In what Part of the City this Place was,
no Authors mention; but ’tis very probable that it was between the
Palace, and the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, from the Authorities both of
<i>Zonaras</i>, and <i>Cedrinus</i>; who having described the Ruines of the Fire,
which happened in the Reign of <i>Leo</i>, both on the North, and South Side
of the City tell us, that in the Middle of the City, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> burnt from
the <i>Lausus</i>, to the Street called <i>Taurus</i>. And <i>Evagrius</i>, speaking
of the same Fire, says, that it destroyed all the Buildings from the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> to the <i>Taurus</i>. The Reader may observe from
hence, that the <i>Lausus</i> was not far from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>.
<i>Cedrinus</i> also in his Description of that Fire which happened in the
Reign of <i>Basiliscus</i>, makes it plain, that it stood Eastward, between
the Palace, and the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. This Fire, says he,
consumed the <i>Chalcopratia</i>, the most beautiful Part of the City, the
<i>Basilica</i>, with its eminent Library, and all the surprizing Ornaments
of the <i>Lausus</i>, to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. There was in the
<i>Lausus</i>, continues our Historian, an infinite Number of Statues, the
most remarkable of which was, the Statue of <i>Minerva</i> of <i>Lindia</i>,
which was four Cubits long, and made of an <i>Emerald</i> Stone. ’Twas cut
by <i>Scyllis</i> and <i>Dipœnus</i>, two eminent Statuaries, and presented by
<i>Sesostris</i> King of <i>Egypt</i>, to <i>Cleobulus</i> King of <i>Lindia</i>, a Prince
of incomparable Wisdom. From hence it is probable the Place is called
<i>Laousos</i>; for <i>Minerva</i> sometimes goes under the Name of <i>Laossos</i>.
<i>Theophrastus</i> writes, that the <i>Egyptian</i> Commentators mention, that
the King of <i>Babylon</i> made a Present to their King of an <i>Emerald</i>,
which was four Cubits long, and three in Breadth. If <i>Sesostris</i>,
<i>Scyllis</i>, and <i>Dipœnus</i> were living at the same Time, <i>Pliny</i> should
rather have called it the <i>Emerald</i> of <i>Minerva</i>. But these were no
less antient, than eminent Statuaries, born in the Island of <i>Crete</i>,
when under the Government of the <i>Medes</i>, before <i>Cyrus</i> was King of
<i>Persia</i>, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span> about the fifteenth <i>Olympiad</i>. They carved the
Statues of <i>Apollo</i>, <i>Diana</i>, <i>Hercules</i>, as also of <i>Minerva</i>, which
was blasted with Lightning. <i>Pliny</i> takes Notice, that <i>Ambracia</i>,
<i>Argos</i>, and <i>Cleone</i> were full of Statues made by <i>Dipœnus</i>, tho’
he says nothing of the Statue of <i>Minerva</i> of <i>Lindia</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i>
adds, that there was placed in the <i>Lausus</i>, the Statue of <i>Venus</i> of
<i>Cnidos</i>, which was looked upon every where as a celebrated Piece of
Sculpture. It was finished by <i>Praxiteles</i>, is made of white Marble,
and appears in a naked Posture. There is also a <i>Juno</i> of <i>Samos</i>, the
Workmanship of <i>Lysippus</i> and <i>Bupalus</i>, and a winged <i>Cupid</i>, with
his Quiver. This Statue was brought from <i>Myndus</i>. There was also a
<i>Jupiter</i> riding upon an Elephant, which was carved by <i>Phidias</i>, and
placed in his Temple by <i>Pericles</i>. There was also another Statue made
by <i>Lysippus</i>, which was bald behind, tho’ not before, which was taken
for the Statue of <i>Saturn</i>. There were also erected here many Statues
of Unicorns, Tygers, Beasts that were half Camels, and half Panthers;
others that were half Bulls, and half Harts, besides several Statues
of Vultures. The unknown Author of the History of <i>Constantinople</i>
says, That in his Time there were standing in the <i>Lausus</i> some Eagles
that were cut in Stone. I am induced to think, that there were some
Figures of Birds standing there at that Time, but believe them to be
the Vultures mentioned by <i>Cedrinus</i>. This Author tells us, that there
stood in the <i>Lausus</i> several fine Buildings, some Hospitals, a Place
for the Entertainment of Strangers, which had very good Spring-water,
and was call’d <i>Philoxenon</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span> Some Writers affirm, that the
<i>Philoxenon</i> was a <i>Cistern</i>, built by one of that Name. I look upon it
to be the same <i>Cistern</i>, which was situate between the <i>Triclinium</i>
and the <i>Lausiacum</i>, and was filled up by the Order of <i>Heraclius</i>.
<i>Menander</i>, surnamed the Protector, tells us, That <i>Philip</i> of
<i>Macedon</i> cleansed most of the <i>Cisterns</i> of the City, which
<i>Heraclius</i> commanded to be replenished with Earth. If that Prince
gave Orders for the cleansing of that <i>Cistern</i>, among others, ’tis
the same which lies under Ground, on the North Side of <i>Abraham</i> the
<i>Basha</i>’s House, between the <i>Lausiacum</i>, and the <i>Triclinium</i>; whose
Roof is supported with four Hundred and twenty four marble Pillars,
two hundred and twelve supporting the same Number of Pillars above
them. I measured one of them, for they all seem to be of a Bigness,
and I found it to be six Foot and nine Inches in Circumference. There
is another <i>Cistern</i> on the West Side of the same House, whose Arches
are supported with thirty two <i>Corinthian</i> Pillars, standing in four
Ranges, each Range consisting of eight Pillars, whose <i>Shafts</i> are
nine Foot in Compass. As to the <i>Triclinium</i>, between which and the
<i>Lausus</i> was built the <i>Philoxenon</i>; I suppose it to be the same which
<i>Justinian</i> the <i>Third</i> built near the Palace, and called it after his
own Name, the <i>Triclinium</i> of <i>Justinian</i>. ’Tis reported by <i>Cedrinus</i>,
that this <i>Triclinium</i> was finely beautified by the Emperor <i>Tiberius</i>.
The Western Gate of this <i>Triclinium</i> is taken Notice of by <i>Leo</i> the
<i>Fifth</i>, when he foretold that the Head of the Man which should be cut
off in the <i>Hippodrom</i> for his Tyranny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span> should be brought before him
through the Western Gate of the <i>Triclinium</i>. Frequent Mention is made
of this <i>Chrysotriclinium</i> by Historians, who wrote just before the
taking of <i>Constantinople</i> by the <i>Turks</i>, and all the Inhabitants both
knew the Name, and the Place where it stood. But the People are since
fallen into such an Aversion to Learning, and a Disrelish of what is
ingenious and Polite, that they rather chuse to embrace a voluntary
Ignorance, and treat every Thing that is curious with Indignity and
Contempt.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="uppercase">IT</span> was impossible for me to discover from the <i>Ancient Description
of the Wards</i>, that the fifth <i>Ward</i> stood on the North Side of the
second Hill, and in a Plain at the Bottom of it, and that it descended
jointly with the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span> Ward from the Ridge of the <i>Promontory</i> to
the Bay call’d <i>Ceras</i>, although the Author takes Notice that a great
part of it fell down in winding Descents into the Bosom of a Plain.
For this Description of it is no less agreeable to other Wards. Nor
could I find out its Situation from any Buildings remaining in it, or
from the Information of the most ancient Inhabitants. All the Light
I could get was from the Situation of the <i>Phosphorian</i> or, as some
call it, the <i>Bosphorian</i> Port, and the <i>Stairs</i> of <i>Chalcedon</i>, which
do not take that Name, because they are built in the Eastern Part of
the City facing <i>Chalcedon</i>, for they stand full North; and so it is
call’d the <i>Bosphorian</i> Port, not from the Sea of <i>Bosporus</i>, but
from a depraved Custom of the People, who pronounce it so; whereas,
according to the Authorities of <i>Stephanus</i> and <i>Eustathius</i>, they
ought to call it the <i>Phosphorian</i> Port. For these Writers assert, that
it took its Name from hence; <i>viz.</i> that when <i>Philip</i> of <i>Macedon</i>
besieged <i>Byzantium</i>, and his Soldiers were digging a Passage under
Ground into the Town, the Moon, which is call’d <i>Phosphora</i>, shone
out in its full Brightness, and discover’d the Stratagem; so that the
<i>Byzantians</i>, the Siege being raised, call’d it the <i>Phosphorium</i>. But
as they give some Reason why it may be thought the same Haven, though
under different Names, yet are they silent as to its Situation, whether
it stood on the Eastern, Northern, or Southern Side of the City; though
it is reasonable to believe, if we consider the Situation of the Stairs
of <i>Chalcedon</i>, which the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i> places
in the same <i>Ward</i> with the <i>Bosphorian</i> Haven, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span> it stood on the
South Side of the City, and not on the East Side, although it directly
faces <i>Chalcedon</i>. For the Force and Rapidity of the <i>Bosporus</i> makes
it very difficult to sail from <i>Chalcedon</i> to the Eastern and Southern
Parts of <i>Constantinople</i>; but ’tis an easy Passage to those who sail
between that and <i>Chalcedon</i>, to go in or out of Port on the North Side
of the City. It is observable farther, that the <i>Ancient Description of
the Wards</i> mentions no <i>Stairs</i> which lie over-against <i>Chalcedon</i>; or
if the Author had taken Notice of any, he had placed them in the first
or second <i>Wards</i>, opposite to <i>Chalcedon</i>, or in the third <i>Ward</i>,
which stands Southward, where the <i>Neorium</i> or the new Dock stood, as I
observ’d before. But it would be of little Significancy to enlarge on
this Matter, since I shall be very particular in naming and producing
such Authorities, as will make it evident, that the <i>Bosphorian</i>
Port, and the <i>Stairs</i> of <i>Chalcedon</i> were not only situate on the
North Side of the City, but shall mention the very Place where they
stood. The first Historian I shall quote is <i>Dionysius</i>, a Native
of the City, who places, just without the Walls of Old <i>Byzantium</i>,
the Temple of <i>Tellus</i> upon the Bay of the <i>Bosporus</i>, and a little
below it the Temple of <i>Ceres</i> and <i>Proserpina</i>, whom he does not call
<i>Proserpina</i>, but only <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρη</span> the <i>Virgin</i>; yet by the Situation
of the Place we may easily understand that Virgin to be <i>Hecate</i>, whose
<i>Tripos</i> <i>Cedrinus</i> mentions to have been in the <i>Strategium</i>, where,
or at least not far from it, as appears from the same Author, stood
the Temple of <i>Proserpina</i>: But <i>Evagrius</i> is more clear upon this
Occasion, who tells us, that in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span> Reign of <i>Leo</i> there happen’d
a great Fire on the North Side of the City, where the Dock stood,
which consumed all before it, from the <i>Bosphorian</i> Haven, to the old
Temple of <i>Apollo</i>; on the South Side, from the Port of <i>Julian</i> to
the Temple of <i>Concord</i>, in the Middle of the City, from the <i>Forum</i>
of <i>Constantine</i>, to the <i>Taurus</i>; and <i>Zonaras</i> adds, that the same
Fire destroy’d all the Buildings between the North and the South Sea.
<i>Cedrinus</i> reports, that the same Fire began at the Dock, and burnt
down all before it, as far as the Church of St. <i>John</i>; from whence
I observe, that the <i>Bosphorian</i> Port and the Dock were near to one
another, although the Author of the <i>Description of the Wards</i>, places
the former in the fifth, and the latter in the sixth <i>Ward</i>. For since
both these <i>Wards</i> join’d together, and descended from the Ridge of
the <i>Promontory</i> down to the Sea, it is not possible that they should
stand at any great Distance from one another. <i>Zosimus</i>, an ancient
Historian, points out the very Place where the Dock was built in his
<i>Description</i> of Old <i>Byzantium</i>. He tells us, that ’twas situate upon
a Hill, which made part of the <i>Isthmus</i>, which was enclosed by the
<i>Propontis</i>, and the Bay call’d <i>Ceras</i>; and adds, that the Wall of
<i>Byzantium</i> stretch’d it self over a Hill, from the Western Side of
the City to the Temple of <i>Venus</i>, and the Sea facing <i>Chrysopolis</i>;
and that it descended on the North Side of the City to the <i>Neorion</i>,
or <i>New Haven</i>, which I take to stand near the Gate which the <i>Greeks</i>
call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὡραῖα</span>, and since by a Corruption of Language <i>Porta
Neoria</i>, or at least not far from it. There is at present between
the Seas and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span> <i>Porta Neoria</i>, a broad Space of Land, a Market
of Merchandize and Sea Goods, which the <i>Turks</i> call <i>Siphont</i>, or
<i>Tsiphont</i>, because the <i>Jews</i> inhabit it. It adjoins to the <i>Stairs</i>
or <i>Landing-place</i> of <i>Chalcedon</i>, from whence they daily sail to
<i>Scutarieum</i>, or <i>Scutaricum</i>, anciently call’d <i>Chrysopolis</i>, a
Mart-Town, and a Port of <i>Chalcedon</i>. Near the <i>Stairs</i> of <i>Chalcedon</i>
is the <i>Ferry</i>, whence you cross the Water to <i>Galata</i>. It was formerly
called the <i>Syc&aelig;ne Ferry</i>, and is placed in the <i>Description of the
Wards</i>, near the <i>Bosphorian Haven</i>, or <i>Dock</i>. But the Situation of
these Places seems to be somewhat chang’d, by reason of some Granaries
built there, (which are removed farther into the City) or for the
greater Enlargement of the Precinct of the <i>Seraglio</i>, or because they
are fallen to Decay, and filled up with Earth. For at that Time, when
<i>Philip</i> of <i>Macedon</i> undermin’d the Town, ’tis very probable that
there was no Port built in that Place, which by the <i>Byzantians</i> was
afterwards call’d the <i>Phosphorion</i>. There was no building a Haven
there, because of the Rising of the Springs, but the <i>Bosphorian</i> Haven
was built afterwards in another Place. And this is no more than what is
said of the Dock, or the <i>Neorium</i>, which they tell you was enclosed
by <i>Constans</i>, and was made a Market of Merchandize, and other naval
Affairs. This Market was afterwards kept near the Port of <i>Julian</i>.
Some Historians write, that <i>Leontius</i> the Emperor, who reign’d after
<i>Justin</i>, order’d the Dock to be cleansed. Others write, that there
was erected, at the <i>Neorium</i>, the Figure of a large Ox in Brass,
which much resembled the <i>Brazen Bull</i>. This Figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> was set up in the
eleventh <i>Ward</i>, which, as some modern Writers would persuade you,
bellow’d once a Year, which portended great Mischief and Detriment to
the City. But this I look upon to be a Fable taken out of <i>Callimachus</i>
and <i>Pindar</i>, who tell you, that upon the Mountain of <i>Artabyris</i> in
<i>Rhodes</i>, there are brazen Bulls that used to bellow upon any Calamity
impending the City. There is nothing remaining of this Haven, where the
Dock was at present. I gather from the Situation of the <i>Bosphorian</i>
Port, and the Stairs of <i>Chalcedon</i>, that the fifth <i>Ward</i> stood on
the Side of the second Hill, and in a Plain below it; where were
also the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Honorius</i>, the <i>Prytaneum</i>, the <i>Bagnio’s</i>
of <i>Eudoxia</i>, the Granaries of <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Constantius</i>, the
<i>Thebean</i> Obelisk, the <i>Bosphorian</i> Port, the Stairs of <i>Chalcedon</i>,
the Cistern of <i>Theodosius</i>, and the <i>Strategium</i>, in which was the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>. <i>Justinian</i> in his <i>Constitutions</i> takes
Notice of the <i>Bagnio</i> of <i>Achilles</i> in a Letter, thus: <i>Our Imperial
Will and Pleasure is, that the leaden Pipes, conducting the Water to
the</i> Achillean <i>Bagnio’s, contrived by your Wisdom, and purchased by
your Munificence, be under the same Regulation and Management, as has
been appointed by</i> Theodosius <i>and</i> Valentinian <i>in the like Case; and
that the said Pipes shall only supply such</i> Bagnio’s <i>and</i> Nymph&aelig;a, <i>as
your Excellency shall think fit, allowing at the same time full Power,
Licence and Authority to the Apparitors of your Excellency, to enter
without Fear or Molestation, such Houses and</i> Bagnio’s <i>in the Suburbs,
as they shall judge convenient, to enquire into all Evasions of this
Order, and to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span> Stoppage of the Water to the Detriment
of the publick</i>. The Law by which <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> enacts,
that <i>Constantinople</i> shall be call’d <i>New Rome</i>, is inscrib’d upon a
publick Pillar, near his own <i>Equestrian</i> Statue in the <i>Strategium</i>.
I find in the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i>, that there were
three <i>Fora’s</i> in the City, which took their Name from <i>Theodosius</i>.
One was in the fifth <i>Ward</i>, and stood, as I just observ’d, in the
<i>Strategium</i>; another stood in the sixth Ward, and a third in the
twelfth. The two last of them were Markets for Provision, the first
was the <i>Forum Pr&aelig;torianum</i>, a Court of publick Justice, where the
<i>Pr&aelig;tors</i> presided, and this I gather from the <i>Treatise</i> just
mention’d, and which was call’d, both by the <i>Latins</i> and <i>Greeks</i>,
<i>Pr&aelig;torium</i>. I am not certain, though it seems very probable to me,
that this great <i>Pr&aelig;torium</i> was beautifully finish’d at the Expence
and Care of the Emperor <i>Justin</i> and <i>Domninus</i>, as will appear from
the following Verses of <i>Paulus Silentiarius</i>. I shall subjoin them in
order to prove, that the Word <i>Pr&aelig;torium</i> was used by the <i>Greeks</i>, as
were also very many other <i>Latin</i> Words.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the sixth Ward, and the remaining

<p class="dropcap2">IT had been very difficult to have discover’d, either from the
Situation of the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, or the Pillar of
<i>Constantine</i> still standing at <i>Constantinople</i>, or the <i>Description
of the Wards</i> (although it takes Notice of the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>,
and tells us, that the sixth Ward enters upon a short Plain, and
that ’tis afterwards lengthen’d by a long Descent) whether the sixth
<i>Ward</i> had been on the North or the South Side of the City, unless the
Author had added, that it reach’d from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>
down to Stairs from whence you sail over the <i>Syc&aelig;ne</i> Ferry. It was
originally call’d the <i>Syc&aelig;ne</i> Ferry from <i>Syca</i>, but is now call’d
<i>Galata</i>, or <i>Pera</i>, as will appear more fully, when I come to speak
of it in the thirteenth <i>Ward</i>. That the fifth and sixth <i>Wards</i>
join’d together, I observ’d before from the Vicinity of the Dock, the
Stairs of <i>Chalcedon</i>, the <i>Syc&aelig;ne</i> Stairs, and the <i>Bosphorian</i> Port
to each other. Having therefore discover’d the Situation of <i>Syca</i>,
I take it for granted, that the Dock stood near a Plain on the Sea
Shore, which was below the Foot of the second Hill, and that the Ferry
Place from whence you passed over to <i>Syca</i>, is the same with that
from whence you sail at present to <i>Galata</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> that the <i>Porphyry</i>

places the Senate-House, how near it stood to the <i>Forum</i> or Pillar
of <i>Constantine</i>. But I shall make it plain to the Reader from other
Historians, in what follows, that the Senate-House stood on the North
Side of the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, and that this <i>Ward</i> stood
partly on the Ridge of the second Hill, where the <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar
is now standing, as is also the Poultry Market, which the <i>Turks</i>
call <i>Taubasor</i>, or <i>Taouck Baser</i>, the Dyers Shops, the House of
<i>&AElig;nobarbus</i>, a <i>Turkish</i> Admiral, and the Mosque of <i>Hali-Bassa</i>. Part
of it spreads itself also over the right Side of the second Valley, and
part of it covers a Plain near the Sea, below the Valley, and the Foot
of the second Hill, which is much inhabited by the <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THOSE Historians who have treated of the Actions of <i>Constantine the
Great</i>, report, that he brought the round <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar from
<i>Rome</i>. This Pillar was bound, at the Joints, with circular Wreaths
of Laurel made of Brass, and was placed in the <i>Forum</i>, call’d the
<i>Placoton</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span> because it was paved with smooth broad Stones, which
the <i>Greeks</i> call <i>Plac&aelig;</i>. They add farther, that there was erected
upon this Pillar a curious Statue of Brass, surprizing both for its
Workmanship and Size. ’Twas an ancient Piece of Statuary, exquisitely
finish’d, even to the Life. They tell you that ’twas originally the
Image of <i>Apollo</i> of <i>Troy</i>, that the Emperor gave it his own Name,
and commanded to be fix’d in the Head of it, some of those Nails
which fasten’d our Saviour to the Cross. Upon the Statue was cut the
following Inscription:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line"><i>To thee, O Saviour, Lord of th’ Universe,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Who rulest the unmeasurable Globe</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>With deepest Knowledge, I this People offer</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>May they be thine, I conquer’d them for thee</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>I lay m’ Imperial Sceptre at thy Feet</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>With all th’ united Force, and Power of</i> Rome.</div>
<div class="line"><i>Let thy good Providence, with watchful Eye</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Look down, and guard the City from all Ills.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><i>Cedrinus</i> relates, that at the Bottom of the Pillar were carved the
twelve Baskets, full of the Fragments which were left, after the
Miracle of the <i>Loaves</i> and <i>Fishes</i>. This Pillar has no Winding
Stairs, but is all solid Marble, and therefore <i>Fulvius</i>, otherwise a
good <i>Antiquary</i>, is visibly in an Error, when he tells us, that it had
an ascent within it. <i>Zonaras</i> says, that the Statue of <i>Constantine</i>
was standing upon the Pillar in his Time, and that in the Spring
Time, in the Reign of <i>Alexius Comnenus</i>, among many other Buildings
which were thrown down by a violent Storm of Wind, the Statue of
<i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span> blown down and demolished, and that by
the Fall of it, several People who were passing by, were dashed to
Pieces. The Author who has wrote the History of <i>Alexius Comnenus</i>,
tells us, that not only the Statue was struck down with Lightning, but
also that three of the <i>Tores</i>, or round Circles of the Pillar, were
also removed. The Pillar is still standing on the Top of the second
Hill; ’tis somewhat impair’d, not so much by Time, altho’ it is very
ancient, as by Fires and Earthquakes, and Tempests. The Statue and the
three upper Wreaths are gone, and in the Room of them there’s a plain
round Superstructure, almost of the same Thickness and Size with the
other Part of the Shaft. The Pedestal of it is made of squar’d Marble,
and is, every Way, eleven Foot nine Inches broad, and eighteen Foot
high. Upon this is placed a Cornice, but after the <i>Doric</i> Manner,
consisting of a <i>Plinth</i>, an upper and a lower <i>Tore</i>, and a <i>Scotia</i>
between them. Upon the <i>Cornice</i> stands the <i>Shaft</i> of the Pillar,
which is about eleven Yards in Circumference. It consists of eight
large Pieces of Marble; each of which is encircled at the Joints, with
a Wreath of Laurel-Work, which covers the Cement of the <i>Fissures</i>. And
if it had not been injured by Time, it would look like one entire Stone
of Marble, and has therefore been thought so by some <i>Historians</i>, who
have handed it down to Posterity, that it consisted only of one Piece
of Marble, and ridicule the Ignorance and Injudiciousness of those,
who, they tell you, have been imposed upon by the Wreaths of Brass,
which were only added for the sake of Ornament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span> There’s nothing of
these brazen Wreaths or <i>Tores</i> to be seen at present, the Pillar, to
prevent its falling to pieces, being bound round with Iron Hoops. At
the Top of the Pillar is carv’d the Name of the Emperor, who after
the Statue was thrown down, lay’d the uppermost Stone of it. This
Pillar bore some Resemblance to those mention’d by <i>Athen&aelig;us</i>, who
writes, that there were some tall round Pillars erected in <i>&AElig;gypt</i>,
made after the same Manner. They were cover’d at the <i>Fissures</i> with
circular Wreaths, alternately white and black, one below another.
Their <i>Capitals</i> were also round, about which was a fine Sculpture of
Roses just opening. There were no <i>Flutings</i> in these Pillars, nor any
coarse <i>Foliage</i> (according to the <i>Grecian</i> Model) which enfolded it;
but it was adorn’d with <i>Dates</i>, and the Fruit of young <i>Lote Trees</i>,
and a Sculpture of all kind of Flowers. Below these, is an Expression
of <i>&AElig;gyptian</i> Beans, intermix’d with Flowers, and a <i>Foliage</i> which
projects beyond the <i>Fissure</i> of the <i>Capital</i>. Thus it is that the
<i>&AElig;gyptians</i> make and adorn their Pillars; and in building their Walls,
it is their constant Practice to lay alternately a Row of white over
a Row of black Bricks. I have seen the same Method in building their
Walls among the <i>Persians</i> and <i>Syrians</i>; the finest of which they
built with Bricks, or Stones naturally variegated, the meaner sort they
colour’d several ways with Paintings, and other Inventions of Art. The
Wreaths or <i>Tores</i> beforemention’d, which were fix’d to the Pillar of
<i>Constantine</i>, were carv’d, as some Writers tell us, to presignify
the many Years <i>Constantine</i> should live, and the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span> Victories he
should obtain over his Enemies. I believe the Design of the Sculptor
was only to express, that the Laurel was sacred to <i>Apollo</i>, and that
this ancient Pillar supported the Image of him made in a stupendous
Size. However that may be, it is certain that <i>Constantine</i> order’d
it to be call’d his own Statue, whether on the account of his many
Victories, or whether he was better pleased with the <i>Heathen</i> Notion
of that God than any other, so that when he demolish’d other <i>Heathen</i>
Idols, he commanded the Statue of a <i>Delphick Apollo</i>, and his <i>Tripos</i>
to be set up in the <i>Hippodrom</i>, as is observ’d by a <i>German</i> Orator,
who address’d himself in a <i>Panegyrick</i> to <i>Constantine</i>, after the
following Manner: <i>When your Imperial Majesty turn’d down to the Temple
of</i> Apollo, <i>the most stately, the most beautiful Building in the
World, you saw your favourite God offering to you his Crowns, a happy
Presage of Length of Days, and a Life extended beyond that of</i> Nestor.
<i>You saw him, you gazed on his Features, and beheld your own Likeness
in him; who, as the ancient Poets have sung, deserv’d the Empire of
the World. That auspicious Period of Time seems to be now come, since
you, like that God, are gay and youthful; like him salutary; like him a
personable and a beautiful Prince.</i></p>

<p>If the <i>Turk</i>, whom I employ’d to climb the Pedestal, had follow’d my
Directions, (while I was obliged to appear a mere accidental Spectator)
and held his Pearch true, I had discover’d the lowest Stone of the
<i>Shaft</i>, from a Notch he had cut in it, to have been nine Foot and four
Digits high; and the <i>Tore</i>, which projected six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span> Digits beyond it, to
have been a Foot and a half broad, I mean the <i>Tore</i> at the Foot of the
<i>Shaft</i>, so that every Stone was ten Foot nine Inches high. The Height
therefore of all the eight Stones was about eighty six Foot and nine
Inches. The whole Pillar was lengthen’d besides with an <i>Abacus</i> placed
on the uppermost Stone, and below with a <i>Pedestal</i> and its <i>Cornice</i>,
and four Marble Steps at the Bottom. The lowermost of these Steps is a
Foot and six Digits high; the second of the same Height; the third and
fourth, each of them a Foot and a half. There is no Discovery can be
made, from what has been said, where this prodigious Column, or rather
where this <i>Colossus</i> stood. For since neither <i>Procopius</i>, nor any
other Historian of those Times, takes any Notice of the <i>Forum</i> call’d
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πλακότον</span>, where <i>Zonaras</i>, and other modern Writers say it
was erected, I was in some Suspence, whether or no this was not the
same with the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. For it seem’d very probable to
me, that <i>Constantine</i> had herein follow’d the Example of <i>Trajan</i>, in
setting up his Statue in the <i>Forum</i>, which went by his own Name. But
I was soon clear’d of this Difficulty, by the Authority of <i>Socrates</i>,
(the Author <i>of the Dissensions among Christians</i>,) who writes, that
they are one and the same Place; and that <i>Arius</i>, when he came near
where the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> stood, expired with the falling of
the Guts. But this is no less evident, if it be consider’d where the
<i>Palladium</i> of <i>Minerva</i> stood; which, as <i>Zonaras</i> says, was convey’d
by the Command of <i>Constantine</i> from <i>Troy</i> to the <i>Placotum</i>, and as
<i>Procopius</i> adds, into the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span> <i>The</i> Hirpines,
says he, <i>report, that</i> Diomedes <i>met</i> &AElig;neas <i>coming out of</i> Troy,
<i>and that in Conformity to the Answer of the Oracle, he gave him the
Image of</i> Minerva, <i>which he, with the Assistance of</i> Ulysses, <i>had
formerly brought from</i> Troy, <i>when they went thither to consult the
Oracle, how</i> Troy <i>might be taken. They add farther, that</i> Diomedes
<i>being indisposed, and consulting the Oracle concerning his Recovery,
it was foretold by it, that he would never be well, till he had given
that Image to</i> &AElig;neas. The <i>Romans</i> pretend that they know nothing of
this Image at present, yet they shew you an Image cut in Stone, which
to this Day stands in the Eastern Part of the Temple of <i>Fortune</i>,
before the Statue of <i>Minerva</i>. The Statue is carv’d in a War-like
Posture, brandishing, as in Battle, a Spear, dress’d in a long Garment,
not representing the Statue of <i>Minerva</i>, as she is figured by the
<i>Greeks</i>, but as described by the <i>&AElig;gyptians</i>. The Inhabitants tell
you, that <i>Constantine</i> order’d this Statue, which was placed in
the <i>Forum</i>, call’d by his own Name, to be bury’d under Ground. The
Authorities that the <i>Placoton</i> and the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> are
the same Place ought to be regarded, because it is impossible to come
to the Knowledge of four of the <i>Wards</i> without them; for the third
<i>Ward</i> contains the Tribunal of the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>; the
sixth reaches from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, to the Stairs against
<i>Syc&aelig;</i>, where is erected the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>. The seventh
extends itself with continual <i>Portico’s</i> from the Right Hand Side of
the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i> to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>, and the
eighth contains part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span> <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. When I was ask’d
by some Gentlemen who were curious that way, how <i>Constantine</i> came by
that <i>Palladium</i>, I answer’d, that I was at an Uncertainty as to that.
For <i>Zonaras</i>’s Opinion of its being brought from <i>Troy</i> did not look
very probable, since <i>Troy</i> was destroy’d so many Ages before it; and
<i>Strabo</i> is hard put to it to trace out the Place of its Situation. The
Story of its being brought from ancient <i>Rome</i> seems very improbable,
since it was often destroy’d by Fire, and the Inhabitants were entirely
ignorant where it originally stood. Yet the <i>Latin</i> Historians tell
us, that <i>Diomedes</i> presented it to <i>&AElig;neas</i>, that it was kept for some
time at <i>Lavinium</i>, and that it was afterwards removed to <i>Rome</i>, and
set up in the Temple of <i>Vesta</i>. The <i>Greek</i> Historians are of another
Opinion. Among these, <i>Pausanias</i>, who wrote in the Time of <i>Adrian</i>,
tells us, that it was held the most sacred of any Thing in <i>Athens</i>,
that it fell down from Heaven, that it was consecrated by the Advice
of all the Senators, and placed in the Citadel of <i>Athens</i>. There has
been some Dispute, whether it was made of Wood or Brass, and whether it
was a Figure or a Shield. Some say, that it was a sacred Shield, such
as they had at <i>Rome</i>. <i>Dion</i> and <i>Diodorus</i> think otherwise, and tell
us, that it was an Image made of Wood, three Cubits high, that it fell
from Heaven into <i>Pessinus</i>, a City of <i>Phrygia</i>, holding in her right
Hand a Spear, in her left a Spindle and a Distaff. To me it seems to
have been the Image of <i>Pallas</i>, whose Statue, whenever it was placed,
was call’d the <i>Palladium</i>. <i>Procopius</i> asserts, that the Statue which
the <i>Romans</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span> shew in the Temple of <i>Minerva</i>, is not cut after the
<i>Grecian</i> Manner. For they carve her, as was mention’d before, in a
fighting Posture, with a Spear in her Hand, denoting by the Spear,
her Courage; by her Shield, her Wisdom, which repels all Attacks: She
is cover’d with a Helmet, to intimate, that the Height of Wisdom is
not to be seen and discover’d: She bears an Olive-Tree as affording
Matter of Light; and upon her Breast is cut a <i>Medusa</i>, to illustrate
the Quickness of Thought, and the surprizing Agility of the Mind. She
had also a Breast-Plate, on which was the Figure of a Night-Owl and
a <i>Gorgon</i>. The Night-Owl was an Emblem of the Depth of Prudence and
Conduct; for Wisdom dives into the Secrets and Darknesses of Nature. I
wish the divine <i>Palladium</i> may guard all those, who shall in future
Times attempt the same Travels as I have done, and pray that they may
be defended, as I have been, by that good Providence, and that heavenly
Wisdom, the Wisdom of the <i>Father</i>, which amidst all the Treacheries
and Insults of a barbarous People, and the almost incredible Dangers of
a long Voyage, did not only support and strengthen, but did animate,
enliven, and refresh me.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar, and the Senate-House, is placed by the Author
of the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i>, in the sixth <i>Ward</i>, and
the <i>Nympheum</i> in the fifth; but he does not tell us, how near they
stood to one another. That they stood at a very little Distance, is
evident both from <i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i>, who write, that the Fire
which happen’d in the Reign of <i>Leo</i>, burnt down the Senate-House on
the North Side of the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, which was adorn’d
with Statues of Brass and <i>Porphyry</i> Marble, in which was placed the
<i>Porta</i> of <i>Diana</i> of the <i>Ephesians</i>, a Present of <i>Trajan</i>, taken
from the <i>Scythians</i>, containing a Description of the Wars of the
Giants, a <i>Jupiter</i> arm’d with Thunder, <i>Neptune</i> with his Trident,
<i>Apollo</i> with his Darts and Quiver. In the lower Part of the <i>Porta</i>
were figured the Giants attacking the Dragons, tossing large Clods
of Earth, and looking in a fierce and a stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span> Manner. Hither it was
that the principal Men of the City usually convened freely to debate
of the important Affairs of the Government, whither also the Emperor
himself came in Procession, when he receiv’d the <i>Consular</i> Robes. It
was a very noble and magnificent Building. The same Authors mention
another spacious Edifice situate against it, which was consumed by
the same Fire, and was call’d the <i>Nympheum</i>, because the Marriage
Rites were perform’d in this Place, as being capacious enough to hold
the numerous Assemblies which attended those Solemnities. They add
farther, that on the West Side of the same <i>Forum</i> was placed a Statue
of <i>Minerva</i> of <i>Lyndus</i>. She had a Helmet on her Head, and a Shield in
her Hand, on which was figured <i>Medusa</i> with Snakes and Adders entwin’d
round her Neck; for in this Manner the ancient Statuaries usually
carv’d <i>Minerva</i>. On the East Side of it was placed the Statue of an
<i>Amphitrite</i>, one of the <i>Syrens</i>, having her Temples encircled with
Crabs Claws. The <i>unknown</i> Author of the History of <i>Constantinople</i>
says, that on the same Side of the <i>Forum</i> were placed the Statues of
several <i>Syrens</i>, which were call’d by some Sea-Horses; three of which,
he tells you, were remaining in his Time, at a Place in the Suburbs
call’d St. <i>Mamas</i>. On the North Side of the <i>Forum</i> was erected upon
a lofty Pillar a Figure of that Cross which <i>Constantine</i> saw in the
Heavens. This is confirm’d by the Authority of most Historians, but
principally by <i>Eusebius</i>, who although he is not express as to his
setting it up in the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, yet as his Authority is
not to be disputed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span> when he asserts, that he set it up in <i>Old Rome</i>
in the Heart of the City, ’tis reasonable to believe that he did so at
<i>Constantinople</i>, since the same Writer assures us, that he set up a
true Representation of the same Cross in all his finest buildings, and
in the most remarkable Places of <i>Constantinople</i>. In Memory of which,
as <i>Sozomen</i> writes, <i>Constantine</i> chang’d the most famous and most
honourable War-like Standard among the <i>Romans</i>, which was always bore
before their Princes, and to which the Soldiers were obliged by Law to
pay divine Adoration, into the Ensign of the Cross, to bring them off
from their heathenish Rites, and idolatrous Worship. <i>Prudentius</i>, upon
this Occasion, has the following Lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Christ<i>’s radiant Form upon the Standard rose</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Emboss’d with sparkling Gems, and burnish’d Gold</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Which o’er the Purple Ground-work cast a Light</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>No dreadful Shields hung on the blazon’d Flag</i>;</div>
<div class="line">Christ<i>’s awful Name alone was there inscrib’d</i>.</div>
<div class="line"><i>While on its Top, sure Sign of Victory</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>The Cross triumphant blaz’d in costly Stones.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Eusebius</i> writes, that he saw the same Expression of the <i>Christian</i>
Standard in his Time. <i>There was</i>, says he, <i>a tall Spear which was
transvers’d near the Top with a short piece of Wood, in the Figure of
a Cross at the Top of which was a Crown made of precious Stones, and
curiously wrought with Gold, in the Middle of which were embroider’d
the two initial Letters of</i> Jesus Christ, <i>with the</i> Greek <i>Letter</i>
X, <i>in the Form of a Cross. The Ensign or Standard was fix’d to the
transverse Part of the Spear.</i> From this Description of <i>Eusebius</i>,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span> Difference between what was then called the <i>Labarum</i> and
<i>Syparum</i> seems to be this; that the <i>Labarum</i> signifies only a
longer Piece of Wood transversed near the Top with a short Piece, and
that the <i>Syparum</i> is the Veil, or Flag, which falls down from the
transverse Part. The Religion of the old <i>Romans</i> was purely military,
they worshipp’d their Standards, and swore by them; which Custom was
abolish’d, upon the introducing the Christian Standard.</p>

<p>I hope the Reader will pardon me, if I here go a little out of my way,
to vindicate the Story of <i>Constantine</i>’s seeing the Cross in the
Heavens, from the Charge of Fiction and Imposture. There is scarce any
Miracle, in my Opinion, which seems to be better attested than this,
or which is capable of being confirm’d by more Eye-witnesses; for
<i>Eusebius</i>, who lived in those Times, writes, that it was not only seen
by <i>Constantine</i> himself, but also by his whole Army, and that too in
the Middle of the Day; and adds, that the Truth of the Fact was not
only believed by the <i>Christians</i>, but by those who were Enemies to the
Cross of <i>Christ</i>. So prevalent was the Report of this Miracle, that
the Inhabitants testify in the triumphal Arch, which they dedicated
to <i>Constantine</i>, that he conquer’d <i>Maxentius</i> by the immediate
Direction and Assistance of the Divinity, although but a little before
many of them were of <i>Maxentius</i>’s Party, and Enemies to the Christian
Name: So that they did not, in that triumphal Arch, made in Honour of
<i>Constantine</i>, change the Form of the Cross into that of our Saviour’s,
but order’d it to be figur’d with such Sculptures and Expressions, as
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span> carv’d on the Arches of <i>Trajan</i>, <i>Severus</i>, and other <i>Roman</i>
Emperors, as appears by some such Monuments of <i>Antiquity</i> as are at
present to be seen at <i>Rome</i>. I cannot conclude with so much Certainty,
that <i>Nazarius</i> was a Christian, because his Daughter <i>Euphemia</i> was
such, as I can, from his panegyrical Address to <i>Constantine</i>. <i>’Tis
the general Discourse among the</i> Gauls, says he, <i>that there was an
Angelick Host seen in the Air, and that they were sent by God; and
although Things of a celestial Nature are imperceptible by human Sight,
because a simple and incompounded Substance is not properly the Object
of our Senses; yet</i>, as he proceeds, <i>these your auxiliary Forces
of Heaven, who are cloath’d with visible Appearances, attended upon
you, as Witnesses of your great Merits, and then withdrew into their
etherial Mansions. But of what Species of the Creation were these
exalted Spirits? Of what Firmness and Vigour of Body; of what Largeness
of Limbs? Their glittering Shields blaz’d in an awful Manner, and the
Splendour of their celestial Armour was terrible: They march’d in such
formidable Array, that they seem’d to wait on you as your Guards. This
was the Language which was heard among them: We are flying to the
Assistance of</i> Constantine. <i>Beings of a heavenly Nature may be allow’d
to triumph, and there’s an Ambition which becomes them. This noble Army
of Spirits who descended from above, were sent down by Omnipotence
itself, and gloried that they fought for you.</i> But I shall add nothing
farther of our Author, and shall only observe, that some Historians
take Notice, that this large Cross was plac’d upon a gilded Column
in the <i>Philadelphium</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span> which was the <i>Poets College</i>, and, as the

<p class="noindent"><i>Julian</i>, the <i>Prefect</i> of the City, set up a gilded Statue of
<i>Anastasius</i> before the <i>College</i> of the Poets, on which was inscribed
a Couple of elegant Verses; yet no Mention is made in them, in what
Part of the City this College was built. When a Report was made to
<i>Manuel</i> the Emperor, that from antient Times, on the West Side of the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, there had stood in the Nich of the Wall two
female Statues made of Brass, one a <i>Roman</i>, the other an <i>Hungarian</i>
Woman; and that the Statue of the <i>Roman</i> Woman projected, by Reason of
its Craziness, beyond its Base, and the Statue of the <i>Hungarian</i> Woman
stood fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span> in its Station; he sent some Workmen to erect the <i>Roman</i>,
and demolish the <i>Hungarian</i> Statue, thinking by this Means, that the
Affairs of <i>New-Rome</i> would take a new Turn of Prosperity and Success.
In the same <i>Forum</i>, among other elegant Statues of famous Men, was the
Statue of <i>Longinus</i>, who had been <i>Prefect</i> of the City, on which was
cut the following Inscription, made by <i>Arabius</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">I shall take no Notice of the Statue of <i>Themistius</i> the Philosopher,
plac’d near the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, whom <i>Valentinian</i> had
dignified with the Title of <i>Prefect</i> of the City, and to whom the
Emperor <i>Valens</i> had done more Honour by his Writings, than any
Statue or high Station whatsoever. <i>Socrates</i> gives us the following
Account of the Death of <i>Arius</i>, the Ring-leader of the Sect of the
<i>Arians</i>. <i>Arius</i>, says he, when he had made his Appearance before
<i>Constantine the Great</i>, at his coming out of the Palace, attended
by the Life-Guards, of which <i>Eusebius</i> was Commander, and passing
thro’ the City, gaz’d at by Crowds of People; when he came near the
<i>Porphyry</i> Pillar in the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, and being informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
upon Enquiry, where there was a Privy, he repairs thither under a
strange Terror and Despondency of Mind, where being oppressed with an
uncommon falling of the Bowels, his strait Gut fell from him, which
was followed by a large Effusion of Blood, which brought away his
small Guts, his Liver, and his Spleen, so that he died instantly. The
same Author adds, that this Privy was standing in his Time. There is
nothing however remaining at present in the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>,
but the <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar, for the Ground of it is wholly rebuilt
upon. Near the Pillar there stands a <i>Caravansera</i>, or a Place built
for the Entertainment of Strangers; and near that, a <i>Turkish</i> Mosque,
built by <i>Hali Bassa</i>, the <i>Vestibule</i> or Porch of which is large,
made of Marble, and adorned with six shining Pillars, four of white,
and two of <i>Thebaick</i> Marble; the Shafts of which measure at the
bottom of them seven Foot and four Digits in Circumference. These,
tho’ they are very tall Columns, have each of them, according to the
<i>Turkish</i> Manner, two <i>Bases</i>; the lowermost of which was Marble, and
the other Brass. This Way of Building they learned from the <i>Greeks</i>,
who generally raised their <i>Pedestals</i> with a very high <i>Cornice</i>.
Not far from this Mosque there stands a School, or College, inhabited
by the Professors of the <i>Mahometan</i> Divinity. There’s a quadrangular
<i>Portico</i> runs round it, which is supported with eighteen Pillars,
Part of which consist of green, and Part of white Marble. A little
below that of <i>Ali-Bassa</i> stands another Mosque. ’Tis seated on the
highest Eminence of the second Valley, and has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span> Marble <i>Vestibule</i>,
adorned with six Columns; two of which are made of <i>Porphyry</i> Marble
variegated, two of white Marble with Sky coloured Streaks, and two of
a dark green Marble stained with White. From some Things, which, as I
remarked before, stood on the second Hill, you discover the Situation
of Part of the third <i>Ward</i>, (in which was built the Tribunal of the
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>) and almost all the fifth and sixth <i>Ward</i>. I
would observe also in this Place, that <i>Dionysius</i> places the Temples
of <i>Tellus</i>, <i>Ceres</i>, <i>Proserpina</i>, <i>Juno</i> and <i>Pluto</i>, partly on
the Eminencies of the second Hill, and partly on the Plain on the
Sea-Shore below it. He places the Temple of <i>Tellus</i> in particular
beyond the Bay, without the Walls of <i>Old Byzantium</i>. He tells us,
<i>That this Temple is open at Top, to shew the Freedom of the Earth in
her Productions, and that the Walls of it are built of a fine polished
Stone</i>. He adds farther, <i>That above the Temple of</i> Tellus, <i>stood
the Temples of</i> Ceres <i>and</i> Proserpina, <i>which were beautified with a
large Collection of fine Paintings, the curious Reliques of preceding
Times, and with Statues no Ways inferior to them, finished in the most
elaborate Manner. The Temples of</i> Juno <i>and</i> Pluto, he tells us, <i>were
situate where the Sea winds off from the Continent; and that nothing
was remaining of them in his Time, but the Names of them only</i>. He
continues, <i>That</i> Cyrus <i>in his Expedition against the</i> Scythians, <i>in
Return of the Preparations made against him by the</i> Byzantians, <i>burnt
down the Temple of</i> Juno; <i>and that</i> Philip <i>of</i> Macedon, <i>when he was
carrying on the Siege of</i> Byzantium, <i>and wanted some Materials for
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span> Purpose, demolished the Temple of</i> Pluto; <i>and that the Names
of each of these Temples still continued: For the Temple of</i> Pluto
<i>was called</i> Acra Plutonis, <i>as was the Temple of</i> Juno <i>called</i> Acra
Her&aelig;a; <i>and lastly, that in these Temples, the Youth constantly at
the Beginning and End of the Year, offered their Sacrifices</i>. It will
appear more probable, that these <i>Acr&aelig;</i> were seated on some Eminencies
of the second Hill, rather than in the Plain below it, because there is
not the least Appearance of either of them in that Place: So that when
<i>Dionysius</i> records it, that these <i>Acr&aelig;</i> of <i>Pluto</i> and <i>Juno</i>, were
situate very near the Sea-Shore, he must intend only that they were
only the <i>Points</i> of some Dock, or Haven. If this be not his Meaning,
the <i>Acr&aelig;</i> here mentioned ought to be interpreted the <i>Sea-Shores</i>;
but I have enlarged more fully on this Matter in my <i>Treatise of the</i>
Bosporus.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Seventh</i> Ward.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Antient Description of the Wards</i> tells us, that the Situation
of the seventh <i>Ward</i>, in Comparison with the sixth, is more upon the
Level, altho’ at the Extremity of one of its Sides, it falls with a
greater Declivity into the Sea; and from hence I concluded, that there
could be little Difficulty in discovering where this <i>Ward</i> stood. But
this Description of it is not peculiar to it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span> common also to other
<i>Wards</i>. For as to what the Author adds, that this <i>Ward</i> stretches it
self with very long <i>Portico’s</i> from the <i>Right Hand</i> of the Pillar of
<i>Constantine</i>, to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>; as it does also on the
other Side of it down to the Sea-Shore, extended in the same Manner: I
could make no more Observations from this Account of it, than I could
from the Buildings which are mentioned to be contained in it, since
the very Remembrance of them is entirely lost. I therefore considered
with my self, what the Author might probably be understood to mean by
the <i>Right Hand</i> of the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>. In this Difficulty
I had Recourse to <i>Livy</i>, who says, that <i>Romulus</i> has determined
all the <i>Wards</i>, which reach from East to West, to be the Right Hand
<i>Wards</i>, and all the <i>Wards</i> which extended from South to North to be
Left Hand <i>Wards</i>. But I could not explain the Difficulty this Way;
for by this Means I had made this <i>Ward</i> to stretch it self Southward;
whereas I shall shew plainly in another Place, that it extended it self
to the North. Nor could the <i>Geographical</i> Method give me any Light
into this Matter; for when these Gentlemen take the Altitude of the
Pole, they look full North, so that the East lies directly on their
Right Hand. <i>Varro</i>, who has defined to an Exactness the four Parts of
the Heavens, following the <i>Astrological Scheme</i>, has given me some
Insight into this Matter: He tells us, that the South lies directly
before us, and the North behind us, so that the East lies to the left
Hand, and the West to the Right. I judged by this Division of the
Heavens into four Parts, that the seventh <i>Ward</i> was situate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span> Westward
of the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>; and yet was in Suspence, whether the
Author <i>of the Description</i> followed the Division of <i>Romulus</i>, or
that of the <i>Astrologers</i>. I was therefore under greater Hesitation
than I was before, till after a diligent Enquiry I made a Discovery
where the Column of <i>Theodosius</i> stood, and of some Footsteps of the
Churches of <i>Anastasia</i> and <i>Hirena</i>, by which I perceived that the
seventh <i>Ward</i> descended from the Top of the <i>Promontory</i> down to the
Bay, and that this Author had described its Situation more distinctly,
had he told us, that as you go from East to West, the seventh <i>Ward</i>
extends it self on the right Hand, from the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>,
to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>. In this <i>Ward</i> antiently were erected
several fine Buildings, which stood on the same Ground where the
most famous Place of Merchandize in the City, by the <i>Turks</i> called
<i>Bezestan</i>, or their <i>Exchange</i>, stands at present, and where the most
valuable Goods of all Kinds are kept, as they were in the Reigns of the
<i>Christian</i> Emperors, in the Building called the <i>Lampterum</i>, which
I believe formerly stood in another Place. I am prevailed upon to be
of this Opinion, when I consider the Ruines occasioned by the Fire,
which happened in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>; and which, as <i>Cedrinus</i>
relates, destroyed, among other Edifices, the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>,
the Place where they kept the <i>Records</i> of it, the <i>Octogon</i>, the Baths
of <i>Zeuxippus</i>, and the famous Structure of the <i>Lampterum</i>, so called,
by reason of the <i>Lights</i> burning there every Night. This Building was
roofed with Wood, where the most costly Commodities, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> as Silks,
Velvets, and the richest <i>Brocades</i> were reposited. In short, this
Fire consumed every Thing, which the former Fire had spar’d. I might
not improperly have called it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπτῆρες</span>, which in <i>Latin</i>
signifies <i>Lucern&aelig;</i>, as ’tis confirmed by the Authorities of <i>Livy</i> and
<i>Pliny</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Street called</i> Taurus, <i>the</i> Forum <i>of</i> Theodosius, <i>the
Pillar of</i> Theodosius <i>with Winding Stairs, of the</i> Tetrapylum, <i>the</i>
Pyramidical <i>Engine of the Winds, the Statues of</i> Arcadius <i>and</i>
Honorius, <i>of the Churches of</i> Hirena <i>and</i> Anastasia, <i>and the Rocks
called</i> Scyronides.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">WHEN I was quite out of Heart as to Discovery of the seventh <i>Ward</i>,
and the <i>Taurus</i>, without which no Discovery could be made of the
eighth <i>Ward</i>, I made the best Enquiry I could after some other
Buildings, which might lead me into the Knowledge of them. And after
I had searched for the Situation of the Pillar of <i>Theodosius</i> for a
considerable Time, I was informed by some antient Persons, that it
stood on the Top of the <i>Promontory</i>, where the Plain of the third Hill
extends it self, which is near the New <i>Bagnio</i> built by <i>Bajazet</i>
the Emperor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> who had demolished that Pillar above forty Years before
I came to <i>Byzantium</i>, that he might build his <i>Bagnio</i> with more
Convenience. Beyond that Bath, Northward, there is a broad Way, where
there are three Booksellers Shops, and an antient Cistern; more towards
the South is the <i>Seraglio</i>. This broad Way widens Eastward into a
large <i>Area</i>, at the farther End of which is the Sepulchre of <i>Bajazet</i>
the Emperor, with a Mosque, and a <i>Caravansera</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> relates,
that this Pillar of <i>Theodosius</i> is, in all Parts, like that which was
erected by <i>Arcadius</i>, and is still standing in the <i>Xerolophum</i>, which
I shall have Occasion to describe hereafter. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, that
the Pillar in the <i>Taurus</i>, erected at the Expence of <i>Theodosius</i>,
whereon were expressed the Trophies he took, and his well-fought
Battles with the <i>Scythians</i>, and barbarous Nations, with his own
Statue at the Top of it, was thrown down by an Earthquake, the same
Year that <i>Old Rome</i> was taken. <i>Anastasius</i> the Emperor ordered many
curious Pieces of Brass Workmanship to be demolished, and new cast into
his own Statue. Among these was a famous Statue of <i>Constantine the
Great</i>, which, with other Statues, made a large <i>Equestrian</i> Statue,
which was gilded, dignified with his own Name and Title, and placed on
the same Pillar, where before had stood the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i>.
I would observe here by the By, that the Street called the <i>Taurus</i>
was the same Place, where the Pillar of <i>Theodosius</i> stood; and from
hence I would observe farther, that the seventh <i>Ward</i> stood on the
Top and Sides of the third Hill. And although the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span> seventh <i>Ward</i> does
not contain the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>, yet it is not improbable
that it was but at a small Distance from it, not only if we consider
how exactly <i>Constantinople</i> emulated <i>Old Rome</i>; but also, if any
Dependence may be had on the Authority of <i>Evagrius</i>, who asserts,
that the Fire which happened in the Reign of <i>Leo</i>, burnt down all
the Edifices from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, to the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Taurus</i>. <i>An antient Native of</i> Constantinople <i>informed me, that in
his Time the</i> Forum <i>of</i> Taurus, <i>and the Pillar of</i> Theodosius <i>stood
in the same Place, and that it was like the</i> Hippodrom, <i>full of wild
and uncultivated Trees. And because it was only a Shelter for Thieves
and Robbers, the Emperor</i> Mahomet, <i>who took the City, voluntarily
bestowed the Ground on those who would build upon it</i>. That the <i>Forum
Pistorium</i>, or Bread-market, stood on Part of the Ground of the <i>Forum</i>
of <i>Theodosius</i>, or at least was very near to it, I conjecture from
<i>Zonaras</i>, who says, that as the Emperor <i>Nicephorus Phocas</i> was
coming out of his Palace, situate at the <i>Golden Fountain</i>, and near
the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, the People pursued him grievously with Railery
and Invective from the <i>Forum Pistorium</i>, as far as the Pillar of
<i>Constantine</i>. The <i>unknown Author</i> of the History of <i>Constantinople</i>
is of the same Opinion, as to the Situation of the <i>Taurus</i>, and the
Pillar, and tells us, <i>That the Pillar stood in a paved Court, near
the</i> Forum Pistorium; and adds, <i>that in the same Place there was
a square Building, with four Gates, and four</i> Portico’s <i>round it,
which he calls the</i> Tetrapylum, <i>which before was called</i> Quatrivium.
<i>Cedrinus</i> places the <i>Tetrapylum</i> not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span> from the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Taurus</i>, when he tells us, that the Fire in <i>Leo</i>’s Time, destroyed
two large Churches, adorned with all Kinds of curious Stones; one
not far from the <i>Tetrapylum</i>, the other adjoining to the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Taurus</i>. The same Author, speaking of another Fire, which happened in
the same Emperor’s Reign, writes, that it consumed all the Buildings
from the <i>Tetrapylum</i>, covered with Plates of Brass, to the Church.
The Author of the <i>Description of the Wards</i> writes, that there was
in <i>Constantinople</i> one gilded <i>Tetrapylum</i>, but does not mention in
what <i>Ward</i> it stood. <i>Johannes</i> the <i>Rhetorician</i> (as he is cited by
<i>Evagrius</i>) tells us, that in the Reign of <i>Zeno</i> the Emperor, one
<i>Mamianus</i>, an eminent Senator, built at <i>Constantinople</i> some handsome
<i>Portico’s</i>, and that between two of them he built a <i>Tetrapylum</i>, as
a Boundary to both, which he splendidly adorned with Brass and Marble
Pillars; and adds, that in his Time the <i>Portico’s</i> bore the Name of
some Emperor, and that large Stones of <i>Proconnesian</i> Marble, the
Reliques of their antient Beauty and Magnificence, lay on the Ground,
but that there was not the least Sign of the <i>Tetrapylum</i> remaining.
The <i>unknown</i> Author abovementioned says, that in this <i>Tetrapylum</i>,
over the Pillars, there was a Chamber, where the Empress, and the
Relations of the Emperor deceased, received the News of his Death; and
having their Faces veiled, bewailed his Departure till six o’ Clock in
the Evening, when meeting the Corpse passing by, they attended it to
the Church of the <i>Apostles</i>, where they usually buried their Emperors.
The <i>Tetrapylum</i> seems to me to have formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span> been the Temple of
<i>Janus Quadrifrons</i>, and stood near the <i>Capitol</i>. It had, like that
of <i>Old Rome</i>, four Doors, denoting the four Seasons of the Year. For
<i>Janus</i> takes his Name <i>ab eundo</i>, and therefore all <i>Passages</i> are
said to be sacred to him, and the Doors of all Temples are called
<i>Janu&aelig;</i>. Some Authors tell us, that in the <i>Forum Pistorium</i> there
was a quadrilateral <i>Pyramid</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> defines this <i>Tetrasceles</i>
to be a quadrilateral Engine, invented to shew in what Point of the
Compass the Wind stood, and adds, that <i>Theodosius the Great</i> erected
a Machine in the Form of a <i>Pyramid</i>, adorned with several Figures of
Animals, of Plants, of Fruits, of gilded Bunches of Pomegranates, and
naked <i>Cupids</i>, in <i>Basso Relievo</i>. Some of these <i>Cupids</i> were cut in
a gay smiling Humour, some of the Uppermost were wantoning, and playing
their little Tricks with those who were below them, while others were
dancing. There was carved upon it a Set of young Fellows playing upon
brazen Pipes. On the Top of the <i>Pyramid</i> was a Vane, or Weathercock,
which shewed in what Corner the Wind sat. The Statues of <i>Arcadius</i> and
<i>Honorius</i> were placed near the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i> their Father;
that of <i>Arcadius</i> in an Eastern, and that of <i>Honorius</i> in a Western
Nich. <i>Socrates</i>, who has wrote the <i>History of the Christians</i>, tells
us, that <i>Valens</i> the Emperor built out of the Ruines of <i>Chalcedon</i>,
a large <i>Aqueduct</i>, which he brought into the City, and which supplied
a very capacious Cistern, built by <i>Clearchus</i>, who was <i>Prefect</i> of
<i>Constantinople</i>, and which, in his Time, was called the <i>Cistern</i>, or,
as the original Word in <i>Socrates</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span> seems more properly to signifie,
the <i>Lake</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i> call this Lake a
<i>Nympheum</i>, and add to the Authority of <i>Socrates</i>, that the <i>Prefect</i>
of the City celebrated there a great Festival, and very splendidly
entertained all the People. I would remark from these Citations,
that the Place which <i>Socrates</i> calls the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>,
is called by <i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i>, the <i>Taurus</i>, and that they
are both the same <i>Forum</i>, and that the <i>Nympheum</i> here mentioned is
different from the <i>Nympheum</i> which is situate near the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Constantine</i>, over against the Senate-House, and where they usually
solemnized their Weddings, as has been observed before. The Author of
the <i>Antient Description, &amp;c.</i> writes, that the <i>Carosian Bagnio’s</i>
were so called from <i>Carosia</i>, the Daughter of the Emperor <i>Valens</i>;
but he does not tell us in what Part of the third Hill they stood,
nor could I discover when I was at <i>Constantinople</i>, whether they are
entirely in Ruines, and others built in the Room of them, (as there
are very large ones at present on the Top and the Sides of the third
Hill, which the <i>Turks</i> have built) or not. The same Author places the
Churches of St. <i>Hirena</i> and <i>Anastasia</i> in the seventh <i>Ward</i>, but
does not mention in what Part of it. Nor is it possible to find out
their Situation, but from the Historical Accounts we have received of
it, which say, that when the City was taken by the <i>Franks</i> and the
<i>Venetians</i>, a Fire began at the Synagogue of the <i>Saracens</i>, in that
Part of the City which declines towards the Sea Northward, very near to
the Church of St. <i>Hirena</i>. That this Church stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span> within the Precinct
of the <i>Seraglio</i>, I was first informed by some antient People of the
City; I afterwards took Notice of a lofty Tower which stood without
the Precinct of the <i>Seraglio</i>, which was situate on the East Side
of the third Hill. It was a square Building, and is still called by
the Vulgar <i>Hirene</i>; but whether it was the Church of St. <i>Hirene</i>,
or the Empress <i>Hirena</i>, I cannot tell. I find among the Monuments of
antient Learning, that there were three Churches at <i>Constantinople</i>
dedicated to St. <i>Hirena</i>. The first was called the Old Church of St.
<i>Hirena</i>, which, as <i>Socrates</i> writes, was built by <i>Constantine the
Great</i>, and stood near the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>. The second, I am now
speaking of, stood on the third Hill; and the third, as <i>Procopius</i>
says, was built by <i>Justinian</i>, at the Mouth of the Bay called <i>Ceras</i>,
or <i>Cornu</i>, and was called the Church of St. <i>Hirena</i> the Martyr. Some
Authors write, that the Church of <i>Anastasia</i> was built in that Place,
where the new <i>Bezestan</i>, or new <i>Basilica</i> now stands: Others that
it was situate near the Cistern, supported with Abundance of Marble
Pillars, and stands between the <i>Basilica’s</i> of the <i>Forum</i>, and the
Tomb, and <i>Caravansera</i> of <i>Bajazet</i> the Emperor. <i>Sozomen</i> writes,
that when St. <i>Gregory</i> went from <i>Nazianzum</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>, he
preached in a small Church built by his Auditors, which was afterwards
very much enlarged by succeeding Emperors, and was also beautified and
adorned in the most expensive Manner, and was called the Church of
St. <i>Anastasia</i>. Whether it was so called, because St. <i>Gregory</i> by
his Sermons preached in this Church had revived the <i>Constitutions</i>
and <i>Decrees</i> of the Council of <i>Nice</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span> or whether, as he adds, it
went by that Name, because a Woman big with Child, falling from the
upper Gallery, and dying upon the Spot, was restored to Life again
by the joint Prayers of the Congregation then present, I shall not
determine. However ’tis plain from this Passage of <i>Sozomen</i>, that
those Historians are grievously in the wrong, who say, that this Church
was built in Memory of St. <i>Anastasia</i>, a <i>Roman</i> Saint. In my Treatise
of the <i>Thracian Bosporus</i>, I have shewn, that on the North Side of
the third Hill there rise some Rocks from the lowermost Eminencies of
it, which were call’d <i>Scironides</i>, by those who first transplanted a
Colony from <i>Megara</i> and <i>Corinth</i>, to <i>Byzantium</i>. These Rocks were so
call’d, because of the Resemblance they bear to the <i>Scironides</i>, which
grow between <i>Corinth</i> and <i>Megara</i>. I shall take the Freedom here just
to mention what’s worth observing on the third Hill. On the Top of it
stands the Tomb of <i>Bajazet</i> the Emperor, near a <i>Caravansera</i>, and a
large Mosque which was built by him, after the Likeness of the Church
of St. <i>Sophia</i>, which is roof’d with Brick-work, and cover’d with
Lead. It has a large Porch or <i>Vestibule</i>, pav’d with white Marble, and
is surrounded with four <i>Portico’s</i>, which are supported with Columns
of the choicest Marble. In the Middle of it is a fine Fountain, which
falls into a large Bason, which emits the falling Water through several
little Cocks. The Mosque and <i>Vestibule</i> is surrounded on three Sides
with a large <i>Area</i>, which is enclosed partly with Walls, and partly
with a <i>Caravansera</i>; and on the fourth Side ’tis encompass’d with a
Garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span> adjoining, in the Middle of which is the Tomb of <i>Bajazet</i>, in
a small Edifice built in a cylindrick Form. On the Top of the third
Hill stands the <i>Seraglio</i>, where the Emperor’s Concubines constantly
reside; ’tis enclos’d with a high Wall, which, at my first Arrival
at <i>Constantinople</i>, was more than two Miles in Compass. The present
Emperor <i>Solyman</i> has taken up a Place in the Middle of this Precinct,
where he is laying a Foundation for a <i>Caravansera</i>, and his future
Sepulchre, which are now building with the most elegant Marble, brought
from several Parts of the <i>Turkish</i> Dominions, so that you may see
infinite Kinds of it lying about the Building, not lately dug out of
the Quarry, but such as for many Ages has been used in the Palaces
of several Princes and Emperors, not only at <i>Byzantium</i>, but in
<i>Greece</i>, and all <i>&AElig;gypt</i>. In the seventh <i>Ward</i> I saw three ancient
Cisterns, not taken Notice of in the <i>Description of the Wards</i>; one
in the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Taurus</i>, another between the Tomb of <i>Bajazet</i> and
the <i>Bezestan</i>, both of which are supported with Marble Pillars. The
third was built on a Clift of the third Hill, which faced the North,
of which there are yet remaining six <i>Corinthian</i> Pillars, very large
and tall, made of <i>Arabian</i> Marble, and curiously wrought. Below the
<i>Base</i> of the <i>Pedestal</i> was lay’d an Earthen Pipe which convey’d Water
into a Cistern made of Brick, whose Roof also, which is Brick-work, is
supported with twenty square Brick Pillars. A little above the Cistern
there was formerly a Court belonging to a <i>Christian Church</i>, which the
<i>Turks</i> demolish’d, to repair and beautify their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span> Houses. On that
Side of the Hill which extends itself Westward, there stands a Mosque,
whose <i>Vestibule</i> is supported with twelve Pillars, six of which are
of <i>Arabian</i> Marble. Above this Mosque there stands another, which is
also supported with Pillars, and was formerly a Church dedicated to
St. <i>Theodorus</i>. This however is not the same Church which <i>Procopius</i>
says <i>Justinian</i> built in a Place call’d <i>Rhessium</i>. There is another
Christian Church, now a Mosque, standing between the <i>Seraglio</i>, and
the Tomb which the Emperor <i>Solyman</i> built for his Son <i>Mahomet</i>, which
is incrusted with several Kinds of Marble, curiously variegated.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the eighth</i> Ward, <i>and the Hind-part of the third Hill</i>.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">I Cannot find by the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i>, that the
eighth <i>Ward</i> was situate on the South Side of the third Hill, though
it says, that the eighth <i>Ward</i>, on the Side of the <i>Taurus</i>, is not
bounded by the Sea, and may be look’d upon to be rather a narrow
than a broad Piece of Ground, though this Defect is sufficiently
amended by its great Length. For by this Description of it, I am left
altogether in Suspence, whether it lye North or South. But I discover
the Situation of the eighth <i>Ward</i> from hence, that the Author <i>of
the Description</i> tells us, that it contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span> part of the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Constantine</i>, and a <i>Portico</i> on the left Side of it, as far as the
<i>Taurus</i>, and that the seventh <i>Ward</i> stretch’d itself from the right
Hand of the Pillar of <i>Constantine</i>, to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>. I
observe from these Authorities, that part of the <i>Promontory</i>, which
reaches from Sea to Sea, situate between the <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar and
the <i>Taurus</i>, was divided into the North and South Side, and that
the <i>Portico’s</i> on the right and left extending themselves from the
Pillar of <i>Constantine</i> to the <i>Taurus</i>, parted the seventh and eighth
<i>Ward</i>, the former of which contain’d the right Hand <i>Portico’s</i>, and
the latter, the left. There’s nothing to be seen of these <i>Portico’s</i>
at present, but only the broad Way which runs from the Church of St.
<i>Sophia</i> to the Land-Wall. This <i>Ward</i> contains also the <i>Capitol</i>,
and the <i>Basilica</i> of <i>Theodosius</i> both of which, ’tis very probable,
stood near the Pillar and <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>. It is no less
evident from <i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i>, that the Fire in <i>Leo</i>’s Time
consumed the Senate-House, built for the Dispatch of publick Business
by the great Council of the Empire, and for the Conveniency of the
Emperor, when <i>Consul</i>, to preside over them. This Senate-House, as
the same Authors add, had twelve Pillars curiously variegated, made of
<i>Trojan</i> Marble, which were twenty five Foot high, the Roof of it being
supported with four Arches. This House, according to these Writers,
was about two hundred and forty Foot long, and a hundred and fifty
Foot broad. I am inclin’d to believe, from what I have mention’d upon
this Occasion, that it was either the <i>Capitol</i>, or the <i>Basilica</i> of
<i>Theodosius</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> For it is plain from modern <i>Historians</i>, that these
two Structures, by whomsoever they were rebuilt after the Fire, lost
their Names, and they tell us, that in the <i>Taurus</i> there was a Palace,
and a Place for the Entertainment of Strangers. And these Authorities
are strengthen’d by some ancient People of <i>Constantinople</i>, who
attest, that in their Remembrance, near the <i>Mint-House</i>, where they
now coin their Money, there stood a spacious Palace, inhabited, as
some say, by <i>Mahomet</i> who took the City, before he built the great
enclosed Palace which stands upon the first Hill, and that some of the
<i>Sultans</i> have since beautified their Palaces out of the Ruins of the
former. The Place of Entertainment, or rather the Church, which stood
to the South-west of the <i>Taurus</i>, I saw entirely demolish’d, and the
Pillars of it carried off, to build a <i>Caravansera</i>, which the Emperor
<i>Solyman</i> erected in Memory of his Son, whom he dearly lov’d. I leave
it to the <i>Greek</i> Priests to make the Enquiry, whether this was not the
same with the Church of St. <i>Paul</i>, which stood in the seventh <i>Ward</i>,
though I could never yet meet with one of them, who could give me
Insight into this Matter.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the ninth Ward; of the Temple of</i> Concord; <i>of the Granaries of</i>
Alexandria <i>and</i> Theodosius; <i>of the Baths of</i> Anastasia, <i>of the
House of</i> Craterus; <i>of the</i> Modius, <i>and the Temple of the</i> Sun
<i>and</i> Moon.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THAT the ninth <i>Ward</i> was situate behind the third Hill, partly on
the Clifts which lye under the Ridge of it, and partly on those which
lye at the Bottom of it, and partly on the Shore of the <i>Propontis</i>,
extending itself as far as the Gardens call’d <i>Blanch&aelig;</i>; I am
convinced, among other Authorities, principally by the Author <i>of the
Description</i>, &amp;c. who says, that the ninth <i>Ward</i> is all a Declivity,
and bounded by the Sea, as also from the Account he gives of the eighth
<i>Ward</i>, which as it is not terminated on the Side of the <i>Taurus</i>,
by any Part of the Sea, I have Reason to believe, took up the Plain
on the Top of the third Hill, but not the Descents below it, and
that the ninth <i>Ward</i> lies partly under the eighth, on that Side of
it, which extends from the <i>Taurus</i> Southward towards the Sea of the
<i>Propontis</i>, and was partly situate also on the two Declivities; one of
which descends from the <i>Taurus</i> to South, South-west, the other from
the Houses of the <i>Janizaries</i> to the South. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span> also discover
by the Situation of the Temple of <i>Concord</i>, where the ninth <i>Ward</i>
stood, which though it be not expressly declared by the Author <i>of the
Description</i>; yet Reason, and the Authority of other Writers, will
lead us into that Discovery. For <i>Evagrius</i>, describing the Fire which
happen’d in <i>Leo</i>’s Time, says, that it raged in a frightful Manner
on the North Side of the City, from the <i>Bosphorian</i> Haven to the old
Temple of <i>Apollo</i>; on the South, from the Port of <i>Julian</i>, to the
Houses seated at a small Distance from the Temple of <i>Concord</i>; and
in the Middle Part of the City, from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> to
the <i>Taurus</i>; and farther, that it extended itself in Length to the
Distance of five Furlongs. From hence it is discoverable, that the
Fire destroy’d all that Part of the ninth <i>Ward</i>, through which you
may draw a strait Line from the <i>Taurus</i> to the <i>Propontis</i>. And this
would evidently appear to any one, who would walk the five Furlongs
from the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> to the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Taurus</i>, and
there fix a Mark, and should afterwards walk Westward from the Port of
<i>Julian</i>, through the Plain on the Sea Shore, to the Distance of five
Furlongs more, and should there fix another Mark, and should compare
that Mark with another fix’d at the <i>Taurus</i>, he would vary very little
as to the Situation of the Temple of <i>Concord</i>. But that, and the
Church of St. <i>Thomas</i> the <i>Apostle</i> are now entirely in Ruins. If we
consider the Rules generally observed in Architecture, ’tis reasonable
to believe, that the Granaries of <i>Theodosius</i> stood near the Port of
<i>Theodosius</i>, which was situate in the Gardens now call’d <i>Blanch&aelig;</i>.
There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span> Port either in the eighth or ninth <i>Ward</i>, but in that
Part of the twelfth <i>Ward</i> which adjoins to the ninth, is the Port of
<i>Theodosius</i>, of which I shall speak more largely hereafter. Above the
<i>Blanch&aelig;</i> to the North, there stands a Temple upon an Eminence, call’d
<i>Myreleos</i>; in the Inside of which was a Cistern, the Roof of which is
supported with about sixty Marble Pillars. In the Place of this Cistern
there was formerly a Granary, which <i>Suidas</i>, though very improperly,
calls <i>Horeium</i>. The Statue of <i>Maimus</i>, says he, who march’d his Army
against the <i>Scythians</i>, stood in the <i>Horeium</i>, (which was before
the House of <i>Craterus</i>, now of <i>Myreleus</i>) near the <i>Modius</i>, and
the Brazen Hands. This <i>Modius</i>, or Bushel, was a settled Measure,
or Standard, according to which they bought and sold their Corn. The
Emperor <i>Valentinian</i> made a Law, that twelve Bushels should be sold
at such a Sum; a certain Sea-faring Man, acting in Violation of this
Law, forfeited his right Hand. This, they tell you, was the Reason why
<i>Valentinian</i> order’d two brazen Hands to be set up in a Nich of some
Place in the <i>Amastrianum</i>, and the brazen Bushel to be placed between
them. Others say, that <i>Valentinian</i> commanded, that this Bushel should
not be sold by the Strike, but in full Measure; and that a certain
Offender lost both his Hands, for not observing this Order. <i>Cedrinus</i>
writes, that some Places here were call’d the <i>Amastrianum</i>, from a
sorry abandon’d Fellow, a Native of <i>Amastrum</i>, who laying under the
deepest Scandal for cursing the <i>Paphlagonians</i>, and to escape the
Punishment of Homicide, fled for Shelter to <i>Constantinople</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span> The
same Author writes, that in the same Place there was a very large
Temple of the <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, where were carved, at the Charge of
<i>Phidalia</i>, the <i>Sun</i> riding in a white Chariot, and the <i>Moon</i> as his
Spouse sitting by him. Below these Figures, near the Ground, was cut a
powerful Prince, prescribing the Rules of Obedience to his People. Near
his Throne was carv’d a <i>Jupiter</i>, in a recumbent Posture, which was
the Work of <i>Phidias</i>. If the House before mention’d was the House of
the learned <i>Craterus</i> a Sophist, there was erected his <i>Suggestum</i>, or
Desk, which has been celebrated in Verse by <i>Julian</i> the <i>&AElig;gyptian</i>.
Besides the Curiosities, the ninth <i>Ward</i> also contain’d the famous
Baths of <i>Anastasia</i>, which took their Name, as <i>Marcellinus</i> says,
from <i>Anastasia</i> the Sister of <i>Constantine</i>. <i>Sozomen</i> writes, that
<i>Marcian</i> the <i>Grammarian</i> was Tutor to the two Daughters of the
Emperor <i>Valens</i>, <i>Anastasia</i> and <i>Carosia</i>; and that the Baths which
went by their Names, were standing in <i>Constantinople</i> in his Time.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THAT the tenth <i>Ward</i> extended itself towards the North, and that it
was situate in the third Valley, and on the East Side of it; as also on
the Top of the <i>Promontory</i>, rising above the third Valley, is evident
from the Author of the <i>Description of the Wards</i>, who writes, that
the tenth <i>Ward</i> is divided from the ninth by a broad Way; that it
lies much more upon the Level; that ’tis in no part of it uneven, but
near the Sea Shore; that ’tis of a proportionable Length and Breadth;
and that it contains the Church of St. <i>Achatius</i>, the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of
<i>Constantine</i>, the House of <i>Placidia Augusta</i>, and many other fine
Buildings. But I could not find, after the utmost Search and Enquiry,
the Situation of any of them; so that I was obliged to have Recourse
to the Authority of Historians who had wrote of these Matters; and in
consulting them, I could not but take Notice of a Mistake in the Author
<i>of the Description</i>, &amp;c. who says, that this <i>Ward</i> contain’d the
<i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, whereas I cannot find, that <i>Constantine</i>
ever had any <i>Bagnio’s</i> at <i>Constantinople</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span> but that <i>Constantius</i>
had. For <i>Sozomen</i>, speaking of those Persons, who, favouring St.
<i>Chrysostom</i> and his Doctrine, were expelled the City, says, <i>That
perceiving the People to be furiously enraged against them, they did
not assemble the next Day in the great Church, but celebrated the Holy
Communion in a</i> Bagnio, <i>which was called the</i> Bagnio <i>of</i> Constantius.
Suidas <i>reports, that</i> Elladius Alexandrinus <i>wrote a Description of
the</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Constantius, <i>in the Time of</i> Theodosius <i>the</i>
Less. Socrates <i>relates, that</i> Valens <i>the Emperor commanded the Walls
of</i> Chalcedon <i>to be taken down, and the Stones to be carried to</i>
Constantinople <i>to build a</i> Bagnio, <i>which was to be called the</i> Bagnio
<i>of</i> Constantius; and adds, <i>That in one of these Stones was cut a
Prophecy, which had been hid for many Ages, but was then explained</i>,
viz. <i>That when the City abounded with Water, a Wall would be of some
Service to a</i> Bagnio, <i>and that numberless Nations of the</i> Barbarians,
<i>should invade the Territories of the</i> Romans, <i>make great Devastations
there, but at last should be overcome</i>. The Prophecy, as described by
<i>Socrates</i>, is as follows:</p>

<div class="line"><i>Shall be despoiled by their All-conquering Sword</i>:</div>
<div class="line"><i>All</i> Thrace <i>shall fear, the fatal Period’s come</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i> write this Prophecy the same Way, but differ
in the <i>Greek</i> from <i>Socrates</i>, and put for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δροσερὴν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερὴν</span>, for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτροῖο</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτροῖσι</span>, for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγρια μαρμαίροντα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγρα μαργαίνοντα</span>, for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλιρόοιο</span>,
κιμμερίοιο. This Prophecy is thus interpreted by <i>Socrates</i>,
who tells us, that it was fully accomplished, when <i>Valens</i> built an
<i>Aqueduct</i>, which supplied the City with Plenty of Water, when the
<i>Barbarous</i> Nations invaded the Territories of <i>New Rome</i>. However,
it is capable of being interpreted in another Manner. For after
<i>Valens</i> had brought the <i>Aqueduct</i> into <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Clearchus</i>,
the <i>Prefect</i> of the City, built a large Cistern in the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Theodosius</i>, into which the <i>Aqueduct</i> emptied it self, and the People
were there entertained at a jovial Feast, and that therefore it was
called the <i>plentiful Cistern</i>, which they tell you, was foretold
by the Prophecy in the Lines abovementioned. But some Part of this
Prophecy was not fulfilled till some Time after, when the Wall of
<i>Chalcedon</i> was pulling down by the Order of <i>Valens</i>. At this Time
the People of <i>Nicomedia</i>, of <i>Nice</i>, and <i>Bithynia</i>, petitioned the
Emperor against it, who being highly displeased with them for it, could
hardly be prevailed upon to comply with their Petition; and therefore
to disengage himself from an Oath he had made to demolish the Wall,
he ordered other Stones to be placed in their Room, as fast as the
old ones were taken down. So that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span> may see at present, what a
mean Superstructure is railed upon the Remains of the old Wall, which
consisted of Stones of the largest, and most wonderful Size. <i>Zonaras</i>
and <i>Cedrinus</i> record it also, that <i>Valens</i> to express his Resentment
against the People of <i>Chalcedon</i>, for giving Protection to his Enemy
<i>Procopius</i>, commanded the Walls of their City to be demolished, and
an <i>Aqueduct</i> to be made of their Stones, which the former Historian
sometimes calls the <i>Aqueduct</i> of <i>Valens</i>, and the latter sometimes
the <i>Aqueduct</i> of <i>Valentinian</i>; and adds, among other Passages of
the History before mentioned, that according to the Prophecy, the
<i>Barbarous</i> Nations made their Incursions into <i>Thrace</i>, but were
afterwards defeated. The <i>Aqueduct</i> of <i>Valentinian</i>, which is highly
arched, passing thro’ the tenth Ward, reaches from the Sides of the
fourth, to the Side of the third Hill. I should be much surprized, that
the Author <i>of the Description of the Wards</i>, who has taken Notice of
the Granaries of <i>Valentinian</i>, has not mentioned it; but that I am
sensible he has omitted many other Monuments of <i>Antiquity</i>, which were
in Being in his Time. In the Reign of <i>Constantine</i>, the Son of <i>Leo</i>
the Emperor (who was a declared Enemy to Images in Churches) and in the
Year of our Lord 759, there was so great a Drought at <i>Constantinople</i>,
that the Dew ceas’d to fall from Heaven, and all the Cisterns,
<i>Bagnio’s</i>, and Fountains of the City were dry’d up; which the Emperor
observing, he began to repair the <i>Aqueduct</i> of <i>Valentinian</i>, which
continued in good Order, till the Reign of <i>Heraclius</i>, when it was
demolished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span> the <i>Avares</i>. Upon this he sent for Workmen from many
Places to rebuild it; from <i>Asia</i> and <i>Pontus</i> he had a Thousand
Builders, and two hundred White-washers; from <i>Greece</i> five hundred
Brick-makers, and from <i>Thrace</i> a Thousand Day-labourers, over whom
there presided a Nobleman, and some of the principal Men of the City,
as Surveyors of the Works. When the <i>Aqueduct</i> was finished, the City
was again supplied with Water, which was conveyed into the Town through
a Passage lying between the ninth and the tenth Ward. There are many
subterraneous <i>Aqueducts</i> which run through six of the Hills, but the
<i>Aqueduct</i> of <i>Valentinian</i> has its Course above Ground, which the
Historians, who have wrote of the <i>Actions</i> of <i>Andronicus</i> tell you,
passed through the Great <i>Forum</i>, that the Water of it was clear and
pleasant, that it was repaired and enlarged by <i>Andronicus</i> himself,
and that he encreased its Current by the River <i>Hydrales</i>. At the
Spring-head, from whence this <i>Aqueduct</i> arose, he built a Tower and a
Palace, where he used to divert himself in the Summer. He also brought
the Water from the same River into the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, which is a Part of
the <i>Suburbs</i>. The Tower was ruined by <i>Isacius</i> his Successor, in pure
Resentment to his Memory. We are told by <i>Procopius</i>, that <i>Justinian</i>
repaired the Church of <i>Achatius</i>, when injured by Time; that he placed
white Marble Pillars round it, and that he paved and incrusted the
Sides of it with the same kind of Marble, so that the whole Building
was beautifully white. There were two <i>Portico’s</i> adjoyning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span> to the
Church, one which opening to the <i>Forum</i>, is encompassed with Pillars.
This Passage is not inserted in the printed Edition of <i>Procopius</i>,
which induced me the more to take Notice of it here. <i>Cedrinus</i>
writes, that the Church of St. <i>Achatius</i> stood in a Place called the
<i>Heptascalum</i>; others say, that it stood in the <i>Scala</i>; but no body
at present knows where that Place was. However, if any one hereafter
should have the Curiosity to enquire where this Church stood, I
would advise him to take along with him the following Direction. Let
him enquire where the great House stands, which Historians call the
<i>Carya</i>, because there stands in the <i>Area</i> of it a Nut Tree, upon
which, they tell you, that <i>Achatius</i> was put to Death, and upon
that Occasion, that a Church was built in Memory of him, which some
think, was situate in the <i>Neorium</i>, because they have seen it in some
Authors, that the Image of St. <i>Achatius</i>, made with Glass Stones, and
inlay’d with Gold, was placed in the Church of the <i>Neorium</i>. But the
Person of whom this is spoke was another <i>Achatius</i>, who, not only, as
many Historians, but as <i>Suidas</i> the Grammarian tells us, was Bishop of
<i>Constantinople</i> in the Time of <i>Leo Marcellus</i>, but a Man of so proud
and haughty a Spirit, that he commanded many of his Pictures to be
placed in Churches, while he was yet alive, from whence he was called
<i>Doxomanes</i>. The House of <i>Placidia</i>, I have observed before, stood in
the first <i>Ward</i>, so that it may be questioned, whether it ought to
be read <i>Domus Placidi&aelig;</i>, or <i>Placill&aelig;</i>, or <i>Placid&aelig;</i>; for <i>Agathius</i>
takes Notice of the Palaces of <i>Placid&aelig;</i> or <i>Placidi</i>, in the following
Inscription.</p>

<p class="noindent">Beyond the Rocks called <i>Scironides</i>, <i>Dionysius</i> mentions a long Shore
in a Plain of the third Valley, and the fourth Hill, which is looked
upon as a remarkable Place for Fishing; for ’tis a very deep and a very
still Water, which was antiently call’d <i>Cycla</i>, because the <i>Greeks</i>
had formerly hemm’d in there the <i>Barbarians</i>. There is also in the
same Place, an Altar dedicated to <i>Minerva Dissipatoria</i>, which was
erected in Memory of that Action. Beyond <i>Cycla</i> is a Creek called
<i>Melias</i>, another famous Place for Fishing, which is enclosed with
several Rocks, and a Ridge of the <i>Promontory</i> hanging over the Sea.
There is no Creek in this Valley at present. Time has filled it up, as
we learn from <i>Strabo</i>, who writes, that this Creek was called <i>Ceras</i>,
because it had many Inlets into the Shore in the Form of a Deer’s Horn,
but there’s scarce any Appearance of them at present. <i>Zosimus</i>, who
wrote his History in the Reign of <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Honorius</i>, tells us,
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> <i>Constantinople</i> was then so crowded with Inhabitants, that the
Emperors did not only enlarge the Walls beyond those of <i>Constantine</i>,
but that they built upon Timber Foundations over the Sea. This Method
of Building, ’tis probable, very much contributed in Time to incumber
and stop up these Inlets of the Creek. At the End of the Creek called
<i>Melias</i>, is a Place which goes by the Name of Κῆπος,
because ’tis very good Garden Ground. Beyond the Garden is a Place
named <i>Aspasius</i>; but of this I have spoken in my <i>Treatise</i> of the
<i>Bosporus</i>.</p>

Ground) unless the Author had subjoin’d, that it contain’d also
the Church of the <i>Apostles</i>, And tho’ at present there’s nothing
remaining of that Church, yet I was inform’d by some ancient People of
<i>Constantinople</i>, who told me, that they remembred it stood upon the
Back of the fourth Hill; which fell upon a Hill of the third Valley,
near the <i>Sadlers Shops</i>, and the Sepulchre of <i>Mahomet</i> the Emperor.
I observe from hence, that the eleventh <i>Ward</i> was Part on the Top of
the same Hill, and Part on the North Side of it. I shall shew by what
follows, that this <i>Ward</i> reach’d to the <i>Land-Wall</i> of the City, which
divided the Eleventh, from the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>, and which was also
itself divided from the City by an intermediate Space of Land. I shall
convince the Reader presently, that this <i>Ward</i> was situate on the
sixth Hill, without the Walls of the City, and was afterwards wall’d
round by <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>. The Walls built by <i>Constantine</i>
are said to have reach’d as far as the Churches of St. <i>Anthony</i>, and
St. <i>Mary</i>, who was call’d <i>Rabdos</i>, and from thence to have risen to
a <i>Land-Wall</i> call’d <i>Exacionion</i>, which took its Name from hence,
<i>viz.</i> That without the <i>Land-Wall</i> there stood a Pillar, on which was
erected the Statue of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>. Some modern Writers
will have it, that he built a Church which he dedicated to the <i>Holy
Trinity</i> in a Place call’d the <i>Exacionion</i>, now call’d the Church of
the <i>Apostles</i>; for, if I am not mistaken, the Walls of <i>Constantine</i>
were built upon the Borders of the fourth and fifth Hill, near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
<i>Exacionion</i>, <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, that the Walls of the City, the
beautiful Churches, the fine Houses seated in the <i>Exacionion</i> were
thrown down by a dreadful Earthquake. They tell us in other Places,
tho’ not consistently with themselves, that there were <i>Portico’s</i>
which reach’d from the <i>Miliarium</i> to the Street call’d <i>Taurus</i>, and
to the Gates of St. <i>John</i> the <i>Baptist’s</i> Church near the <i>Hippodrom</i>,
which are more than a thousand <i>Roman</i> Paces distant from the Church of
the <i>Apostles</i>, and as far from the Walls of the City which were built
by <i>Constantine</i>, as may be gather’d from the following Passage of
<i>Sozomen</i>. <i>Theodosius</i>, says this Author, <i>leading his Army against</i>
Eugenius, <i>went a Mile out of the City to the Church of St.</i> John,
<i>which he had built in the</i> Hepdomum. This <i>Hepdomum</i> was a Part of
the Suburbs of the City, but is now enclos’d within the Walls, as
will appear when I come to speak of it. If the Pillar from whence the
<i>Exacionion</i> took its Name, was the same with that high Pillar which
stood on the Top of the fifth Hill, and was seen not long since at a
great Distance from the City, above all the Houses, we might easily
discover, that the Walls built by <i>Constantine</i> did not reach beyond
this Pillar, which stood about half a Mile’s distance from the <i>Church</i>
of the <i>Apostles</i>. I saw this Pillar took to Pieces, and remov’d for
building a Mosque, by Order of <i>Solyman</i> the Emperor. The <i>Base</i>,
the <i>Pedestal</i> and the Foundation of it were of white Marble. The
Foundation-Stone alone was so high, that I could not climb it without
a Ladder. The <i>Pedestal</i> was four Foot and nine Digits high, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
<i>Plinth</i> one Foot, and six Digits. The <i>Greeks</i> and the <i>Turks</i>, each
in their Dialect, call’d it the <i>Pillar</i> of the <i>Virgin</i>, which I
take to be that celebrated by our modern Writers, which they say was
erected upon a Hill, and supported the Statue of <i>Venus</i>, carv’d in
Stone. When the <i>Ancient Description of the Wards</i> tells us, that the
eleventh <i>Ward</i> is no Ways bounded by the Sea, it must be so understood
as to mean, that the Plain situated between the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, and
the Foot of the fourth Hill, was not within the Walls, since the same
<i>Treatise</i> mentions, that the City was six thousand one hundred and
fifty Foot broad; that is, a Mile and two hundred and thirty Paces; for
the Latitude of the <i>Isthmus</i>, which stretches itself over the fourth
and seventh Hill, thro’ which the old Wall extended itself, exceeds the
Breadth abovemention’d. But <i>Zosimus</i>, an ancient Historian, says, that
<i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> so wholly surrounded the City with a Wall,
that it cut off the <i>Isthmus</i> from Sea to Sea. So that upon the whole,
there is a Necessity to place the Plain, situate between the Bay, and
the Bottom of the fourth Hill, in the tenth <i>Ward</i>.</p>

Great, the Cistern of</i> Arcadius <i>and</i> Modestus, <i>of the Palace of</i>
Placilla, <i>and the</i> Brazen Bull.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">’TIS attested by <i>Eusebius</i>, That <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> built the
Church of the <i>Apostles</i> to a great Heighth, that he incrusted it with
all Sorts of variegated Marble, which cast a beautiful Lustre from Top
to Bottom; that he adorn’d it with small gilded Roofs, and cover’d
it with Plates of Brass deeply gilt, which cast a blazing Reflexion
to a great Distance. The upper Part of this venerable Structure, was
curiously wrought all round it with Brass and Gold, and was enlightned
with Abundance of Lattices and Windows. Round the Church there was
a fine Court lying open to the Air. The <i>Portico’s</i> which enclos’d
it, stood in a Quadrangular Manner. Near the <i>Portico’s</i> stood the
Palace, the <i>Bagnio’s</i>, the Cloysters, and many other Houses and
Buildings belonging to the Ecclesiasticks, and other Ministers of the
Church. These bountiful Benefactions has the pious Emperor handed
down to Posterity in Memory of the <i>Apostles</i> of the blessed Saviour
of Mankind, to whom also he consecrated twelve Purses of Gold. The
Coffin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span> in which he intended to be buried after he was dead, was
plac’d by his Order in the Body of the Church, and guarded with the
twelve <i>Apostles</i> in Effigy. ’Tis added by <i>Socrates</i>, that the Body
of <i>Constantine</i> lying in a golden Coffin, was brought into the City
by his intimate Friends, and buried in the Church of the <i>Apostles</i>.
I am inclin’d to believe, that <i>Zonaras</i> never read <i>Eusebius</i>, when
he tells us, that ’twas buried in the Cloyster of the Church of
the <i>Apostles</i>, which, he says, was built by <i>Constantius</i> for the
Interrment of his Father. Near the broad Way which stretches itself
along the Top of the <i>Promontory</i>, from the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>,
to the Gate of <i>Adrianople</i>, (hard by the Place where stood the
Church of the <i>Apostles</i>,) there is shewn to this Day, a Coffin made
of <i>Porphyry</i> Marble, empty; and without a Cover, ten Foot long, and
five Foot and a half broad, which the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Turks</i> say, was
the Coffin of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>; but I cannot vouch for the
Truth of it: Yet the Authorities of <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Eusebius</i> seem
to be somewhat doubtful, who tell us, that he was buried in a golden
Coffin, unless perhaps the golden Coffin was inclos’d in that of the
<i>Porphyry</i> Marble. <i>Zonaras</i> is of Opinion, that <i>Theodora</i>, the Wife
of <i>Justinian</i>, built the Church of the <i>Apostles</i>; and adds, that
there was anciently in the same Place a <i>Church</i> of the <i>Apostles</i>,
but much Inferior in Beauty and Magnificence to that which stands at
present, on the same Ground. <i>Procopius</i> says, that there had been
for some Ages, a Church at <i>Constantinople</i> which was much impair’d
by Time, and likely to fall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span> which <i>Justinian</i> order’d to be taken
down, rebuilt, and enlarg’d, and made in the Figure of a Cross, the
Body of the Church pointing East, and West, and the Part crossing it,
North, and South. This Church is well wall’d, and adorn’d within with
Ranges of Pillars standing one above another: <i>Evagrius</i> therefore
seems to be mistaken, in attributing the Building of this Church to
<i>Justinian</i>, when it is evident it was built by <i>Constantine</i> the
<i>Great</i>; and <i>Procopius</i> too grosly flatters <i>Justinian</i> in ascribing
to him the Building of many fine Structures, whereas, in reality, he
only repair’d them when they were old, or rebuilt them when fall’n too
much to decay, or destroy’d by Fire. There’s nothing remaining of this
Church at present, no, not even of its Foundation. You see only the
Ruines of an old <i>Cistern</i>, which supply’d the Church, and the Clergy
with Water. There are now standing upon the same Spot of Ground about
two hundred <i>Sadlers Shops</i>, and <i>Work-houses</i>, where they make and
sell not only all kinds of Horse-Geer, but also Leathern Bucketts,
Quivers, and Trunks. A little above this <i>Cistern</i>, stands a Mosque,
with a <i>Caravansera</i> adjoining to it, situate on a Plain, which was
built with square Stone, after the Form of the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>,
out of the Ruins and Sacrilege of the Church of the <i>Apostles</i>, and
other Christian Churches by <i>Mahomet</i>, who took the City. The Roof is
of a Semicircular Figure, made of Brick-Work, and cover’d with Lead,
as are all the publick Buildings of the <i>Turks</i>. ’Tis beautify’d with
a very elegant square Porch as broad as the Church itself, pav’d with
the finest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span> Marble, and adorn’d with square <i>Portico’s</i>. The Arches of
them, which bear up the Roof, are supported with very large Pillars of
Marble, curiously variegated. In the Middle of it is a Fountain with
nine Pipes, whose Waters fall into a great Bason. Round the Mosque is
a spacious Court, Part of which is enclos’d with Walls, and Part with
long kind of Houses, some of which are inhabited by their Priests, and
School-Masters. In the Eastern Part of this Court there’s a Garden,
in the Middle of which stands the Sepulchre of <i>Mahomet</i>, built in a
Cylindric Form of the whitest Marble. ’Tis covered with Lead, lighted
with Windows, and has a Door of Entrance into it. In the Middle of
this Structure is the Coffin of <i>Mahomet</i>, cover’d with Velvet, placed
on the Ground on a rich Carpet. The Ground is wholly covered with the
most costly Carpets, where the Priests continually sit, and guard
the Body Night and Day. A little without the Court are several large
<i>Caravansera’s</i>, built also with square Stone, which have Court-yards
in the Middle of them, and <i>Portico’s</i> surrounded with Marble Pillars.
These <i>Caravansera’s</i> have large Gardens adjoyning to them. In short,
this Mosque, with the adjacent Buildings round the Court, with the
<i>Caravansera’s</i> and Gardens, take up a Space of Ground six Furlongs
in Compass. <i>Mahomet</i>, the same Emperor, built in this Place, where
had formerly been the Old <i>Cistern</i> of <i>Arcadius</i>, or <i>Modestus</i>, the
largest <i>Bagnio’s</i> in all the City. These Baths were of two Kinds,
some for Men, and some for Women. They adjoin to each other, but have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
different Entries without any Passage out of one into the other. I
shall only describe the Mens Baths; because the Womens are like them.
The first Place you enter is the Room where they undress. From hence
you pass into the hot, and from thence into the cold Bath. They all
stand in one Range, and are only separated by Walls from each other.
The Room where they undress is a square Structure, built of square
Stone up to the Roof, which is arch’d and built with Brick; the Inside
of which, measuring two hundred and fifty eight Foot in compass, is
surrounded with an Ascent of Stone, above six Foot broad, and three
Foot high. The Wall of this Room, from the Pavement to the Bottom of
the arch’d Roof is thirty seven Foot high. In the Middle of the Floor,
which is pav’d with Marble, there’s a large Marble Bason, which is
thirty seven Foot in compass, and three Foot deep, which is always
supply’d from a Fountain of Spring Water. There are two Doors out of
the stripping Room into the hot Bath. This Apartment is a hundred Foot
in compass in the Inside of it, and is supported with four Arches,
which bear up a <i>Dome</i> at the Top. It contains eight <i>Cells</i> or bathing
Rooms; one of which, not above half so large as the rest, has some
Privies behind it, which are cleans’d by an Efflux of all the Waters
which are turn’d out of the Bath. Six of these <i>Cells</i> have, each of
them, a bathing Cistern, and are built in such a Manner, that two of
these Arches hang each of them over one bathing Room; from whence you
may pass, on the Right and on the Left, into another. The <i>Cells</i> under
the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span> two Arches are so form’d, that that Arch which is nearest
the Doors which lead out of the stripping Room into the hot Bath, hangs
over a very large bathing Room. ’Tis pav’d with Marble, and the <i>Turks</i>
wash their Linen in this Place. A plain Wall arch’d at top parts the
hot from the cold Bath. In the Middle of the hot Bath there is a Bason
with a Fountain playing. There is but one Door which leads out of the
hot into the cold Bath. This Apartment has eight Arches which support
its <i>Dome</i>, and contains eight bathing Places, which project beyond the
Sphere of its <i>Dome</i>, and encircle the whole <i>Bagnio</i>, which is about
ninety Foot in compass. The whole Pavement of it is lay’d with Marble,
and in the Middle of it is built an Ascent in the Form of an <i>Octagon</i>,
which is fifty seven Foot, and nine Inches in Circumference, and two
Foot and four Digits high. Round the <i>Octagon</i> there runs a Channel of
Water, which is of the same Depth with the Height of the <i>Octagon</i>.
The four inward bathing Rooms are situate in four Angles, and are each
of them every Way eleven Foot and three Digits broad, and these are
call’d the <i>Hot-Houses</i> or <i>Sweating-Bagnio’s</i>. The Dimension of the
two Bathing Rooms, which are situate without the two Arches, is the
same. The other six Bathing Rooms are of a Semicircular Figure, and
stand under six Arches within the Circle of the <i>Dome</i> of the hot Bath.
At the Bottom of the Pillars which support the Arches, they are eleven
Foot in length, and five Foot nine Inches in breadth. Every one of
these Bathing Rooms has a Marble <i>Cistern</i> wherein they bath; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
one of them above the rest, there is erected a stately Marble Throne.
There are no Lights in the Walls either of the hot or cold Baths, tho’
the <i>Domes</i> of them are wholly illuminated with Glass-Windows. The
<i>Stoke-Hole</i>, which is two Foot and a half in compass, and of the same
height, is built without the Baths. They keep a constant Fire in it,
which heats a Brazen Vessel, whence it emits its warm Steams thro’
Pipes laid in a strait, and an oblique Manner, by that means heating
the Bottom of the <i>Cisterns</i> in which they bath. There is a Rivulet
in a Field of the Suburbs, about six Foot in breadth, which runs near
the <i>Stoke-Hole</i>. There are Pipes laid in this Brook, which convey the
Water thro’ the Walls of these Baths into all Parts of them. One of
these Pipes which passes thro’ a heated Earthen Vessel, upon turning
a Cock, supplies the <i>Cisterns</i> with hot Water; the other Pipe which
rises higher, upon the turning of an other Cock, tempers the hot Water
according to the Pleasure of the Person who baths in it. But I shall
treat of the Use of Bathing, and the Way of building <i>Bagnio’s</i> among
the <i>Turks</i> in another Place. I return now to the eleventh <i>Ward</i>,
which <i>Procopius</i> takes Notice of, when he tells us, that <i>Theodora</i>
the Consort of <i>Justinian</i> address’d herself to him in the following
Manner: <i>We have, may it please your Imperial Majesty, other Palaces
still remaining, which are call’d the Palaces of</i> Helena, <i>as we have
also those of</i> Placilla, <i>the Wife of</i> Theodosius <i>the Great. For as</i>
Justinus <i>honour’d his Empress with several noble Palaces, which,
after her own Name, were call’d the Palaces of</i> Sophia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span> <i>so it is
highly probable that</i> Theodosius <i>did</i> Placilla <i>the same Honour in
building a Palace for her, which was call’d the Palace of</i> Placilla.
<i>I am induc’d to believe this, because he passionately lov’d her, and
by Reason of that strong Resentment he bore to the People of</i> Antioch,
<i>whom he subjected to the Dominion of the</i> Laodenses, <i>for demolishing
the Statues of</i> Placilla, <i>plac’d in his own</i> Forum, <i>because he lay’d
an additional Tribute upon them</i>. This Palace may not improperly be
call’d also the Palace of <i>Flacilla</i>, of whom <i>Claudian</i> speaks in the
following Lines:</p>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Brazen Bull</i> was plac’d in the eleventh <i>Ward</i>. In what Part of
that <i>Ward</i> it was plac’d might easily be conjectur’d from a large
<i>Cistern</i>, which, the modern Historians write, was built near it by
<i>Nicetas</i> an Eunuch, in the Reign of the Emperor <i>Theophilus</i>, if that
<i>Cistern</i> was now in being. If the <i>Bull</i> itself was remaining, or the
<i>Forum</i> where it stood, I had heard something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span> of it. <i>Tzetzes</i> in his
History writes, that the <i>Forum Bovis</i> was so call’d from the <i>Brazen
Bull</i>. This <i>Bull</i> is more particularly describ’d by <i>Zonaras</i>, who
says, <i>that the Body of the unhappy Tyrant</i> Phocas <i>was burnt at a
Place call’d</i> Bos, <i>where there was a Stove, or Fire-Place set up in
the Form of a Bull, which was brought from</i> Troy. <i>Cedrinus</i> relates,
that <i>Antypas</i> the <i>Martyr</i> was burnt to Death in this <i>Bull</i>. It is a
plain Instance of the Cruelty and Tyranny of some of the Emperors of
<i>Constantinople</i>, that they us’d to punish Malefactors with a Death
so tormenting. The like Example of Barbarity we have in <i>Perillus</i>,
or rather <i>Perilaus</i>, a Brazier of <i>Attica</i>, who made a <i>Brazen Bull</i>
for the Execution of <i>Phalaris</i>, but first suffer’d in it himself.
This Piece of Workmanship, says <i>Pliny</i>, was preserv’d a long Time,
that those, who saw it, might curse the Hand that made it. I am more
inclin’d to believe, that this <i>Bull</i> was brought from <i>Sicily</i>, or
<i>Italy</i>. I enquir’d after it, but could hear nothing of it, altho’ the
Inhabitants are not ignorant, that there was formerly such a <i>Bull</i> at
<i>Constantinople</i>, and are us’d to boast of a Prophecy, which has been
handed down to them from their Ancestors, concerning such a <i>Bull</i>,
and lastly, altho’ they believe their own Interpretation of it to be
more agreeable to Truth than that of <i>Tzetzes</i>, who explain’d it above
three hundred and seventy Years ago in the following Manner. There was
a mighty Talk of a Prophecy at <i>Constantinople</i> some Time ago, which
run in these Words: Βοῦς βοήσει τε, καὶ Ταῦρος δὲ θρηνήσει,
<i>Bos mugiet, Taurus lugebit</i>. The People conjectur’d from hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span> says
he, that great Calamities should befall the City, that they should be
perplex’d with amazing Fears, that an innumerable Army of <i>Germans</i>,
and other Nations, should come against the Town; and that they should
be all terrify’d and affrighted with strange Dreams, by Reason of the
Plundering and Destruction of their City. Upon which, the Wife of
the <i>Grand Het&aelig;riarch</i> being in great Consternation, and her Fears
and Fancies being encreas’d by some fabulous Verses made upon the
Occasion, she imagin’d she dream’d of all that had been the Town-Talk
for some Time before. She dream’d that <i>Constantinople</i> was wall’d
round with Brick, that near the <i>Forum Bovis</i>, or the Place call’d
<i>Bos</i>, she saw infinite Numbers of arm’d Forces drawn up in Battle
array, and that hard by the Street call’d <i>Taurus</i>, she saw a Man in
a melancholly Posture expressing his Grief in a mournful Tone, and
beating his Breast. The credulous Woman believing the Destruction of
the City was at hand, told her Dream to <i>Tzetzes</i>, who thus interpreted
it: <i>The Brick Walls</i>, says he, <i>which you saw denote great Plenty of
Provision to</i> Constantinople. <i>You are sensible, Gentlemen</i>, says he,
(speaking to those who stood by him) <i>how wonderfully that Part of
the Prophecy was accomplish’d at that Time. As to that Clause of it,
which mentions that abundance of armed Forces shall stand round the</i>
Bull, <i>and that a Man in a disconsolate and forlorn Condition shall
sit down by the</i> Bull, <i>which is principally intended by the Prophecy,
tho’ not yet fulfill’d; this may prove beneficial, and advantageous
to every Citizen of us. Therefore hear, O</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span> Constantinople, <i>and tell
it to others, that this is the Interpretation of</i> Tzetzes. <i>The same
Word, which among us</i> Greeks <i>signifies a Bull, signifies also a Cow,
and sometimes a Heifer, and by the Word</i> Taurus <i>or</i> Bull, <i>the</i> Latins
<i>call the</i> Italian <i>Bull. Our Cow therefore, which is the famous
City of</i> Constantine, <i>and which was built by the</i> Roman <i>Bulls of</i>
Italy, <i>full of Arms, abounding with Forces, and Plenty of Provision,
shall sound an Alarm against our Enemies; and the</i> Italian <i>Bull,
which is the Army of the</i> Latins, <i>shall look Pale with Fear, and
mourn</i>. <i>Tzetzes</i>, without Question, was a very learned Man, and this
Interpretation of the Prophecy was cunning enough; besides that it was
a fine Compliment to the Empress, and at the same Time the Historian
pleas’d his own Humour in it, in interpreting the Prophecy according
to his own Wishes. See how ingenious is the Weakness of Man to impose
upon himself! But at that Time there was another Interpretation of this
Prophecy, which, in the Event, was much more agreeable to Truth, tho’
<i>Tzetzes</i> took a great deal of Pains to confute, and expose it; and it
was the general Opinion of the People of <i>Constantinople</i>, that the
Army of the <i>Latins</i> would besiege their City, as it happen’d a little
Time after, ravaging, burning, destroying every where; throwing some of
the Ring-leaders of an arbitrary Party from the Top of <i>Theodosius</i>’s
Pillar into the Street call’d <i>Taurus</i>, and burning others to Death
in the <i>Brazen Bull</i>. The same Author is no less mistaken in the
Interpretation of another Prophecy, which is as follows: <i>Wo be to
thee, O</i> Constantinople, <i>seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span> on seven Hills, thou shalt not
continue a thousand Years</i>. His Explanation of it is this: <i>Altho’ it
be not thy Fate, O</i> Constantinople, <i>to endure a thousand Years, but
to be totally demolish’d, yet this ought to be no Occasion of Grief to
thee, but the Cause of Joy; for thou shalt rise again from thy Ruines
more beautiful, and more enlarg’d. For thou shalt be destroyed, ev’n
to the Advantage of those who shall destroy thee.</i> This Interpretation
is a downright Flattery of the principal Leaders of the several
<i>Factions</i> (or Companies of Charioteers) when they were struggling
for the Government. But take this Interpretation which Way you will,
it seems to be a very wild one. For whether the City was demolish’d
by its own Inhabitants, or any foreign Power, it could neither Way be
any reasonable Cause of Joy to them. This Prediction of the Oracle
was seconded by another Prediction of the <i>Astronomers</i> to the same
Purpose. Some Historians have attested, as ’tis confirm’d by <i>Suidas</i>,
that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, after he had finish’d the City, sent
for one <i>Valens</i> an <i>Astronomer</i> of great Skill, and commanded him to
enquire what Star had the <i>Ascendant</i> at the Birth of the City, and by
that means inform him of the Duration of it. <i>Valens</i> predicted that
the City would continue six hundred and ninety Years; but that Time is
past and gone. Therefore, says <i>Zonaras</i>, I must conclude, that this
Prophecy of <i>Valens</i> was erroneous, and that there’s little Dependance
to be had upon the Rules of <i>Astronomy</i>, or otherwise that <i>Valens</i>
only meant the Time of her Prosperity, when the Laws of Polity were
strictly obey’d, when the publick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span> Peace was preserv’d, when their
<i>Senate</i> was in high Estimation among the People, when the Empire
flourish’d and was under a regular Administration, and there was no
such Thing as Tyranny, and Arbitrary Power among them. But to finish
the Oracular Predictions concerning this City, I come now to <i>Zosimus</i>,
a very ancient Historian, if compar’d with <i>Tzetzes</i>, and <i>Zonaras</i>.
This Author writes, that <i>Constantinople</i> was arriv’d to such a State
of Grandeur, and Magnificence, that no City in the World was to be
compar’d with it, in point of Greatness, or Prosperity. <i>And yet</i>, as
he proceeds, <i>when after a long Search I could find no divine Oracle,
or Prophecy presignifying any Increase of Happiness to</i> Constantinople,
<i>I at last accidentally, having read many Historians, and other Authors
for that Purpose, met with an Oracular Prediction of a Sibyl, nam’d</i>

<p class="noindent">This Oracle or Prophecy, says <i>Zosimus</i>, truly fore-tells, tho’ in
an &AElig;nigmatical Manner, all the Calamities which would befall the
<i>Bythinians</i>, by Reason of an excessive Tribute which had been demanded
of them, and presignifies also their speedy Subjection to the Empire of
<i>Constantinople</i>. And tho’ this did not happen till a long Time after,
yet let no Man from thence infer, that the Time of the Accomplishment
of the Prediction was expired before it came to pass. For all Time is
but for a Moment with God, who is eternal. <i>This Interpretation of the
Oracle</i>, says the Historian, <i>I observed to be true, by comparing the
Event of Things with the Words of the Prophecy</i>; and adds, <i>that if
any other Interpretation seems more agreeable, any one is at his own
Liberty to follow it</i>. And to confirm the more this Explication of it,
he tells us, how <i>Constantine</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span> <i>Great</i> and his Sons, oppress’d not
only <i>Bithynia</i>, but the whole World with severe Exactions, so that
whole Cities, unable to pay the Levies, remained desolate. The learned
<i>Tzetzes</i> before-mentioned, explains this Oracle in another Manner,
and says, that it was delivered by <i>Phaenno</i>. <i>This Sybil</i>, says he,
<i>was long ago famous for her Oracles, and foretold same Things many
Ages since, which were accomplished but a little before the Times we
live in; as the Conquest of</i> Persia <i>over the Empire, the Slavery and
Subjection of the Emperor to them, his Dethronement by his People and
Nobles, the Wars of the</i> Scythians <i>with the Eastern Empire, by whom
she seems to mean the</i> Turks. Thus far <i>Zosimus</i>. This Oracle, tho’ it
be very antient, yet, amidst the present Ruins of <i>Constantinople</i>, it
never appeared so manifest as now.</p>

<p>But to proceed in my Narration of other Monuments of Antiquity; On
the Brow of the fourth Hill, which lies Eastward, you see a Church
built to the Honour of Almighty God, which has been much celebrated
in the Writings of modern Historians. The Walls of it within side
are incrusted with several Kinds of Marble: It has two Porches or
<i>Vestibules</i>, many lesser <i>Cupola’s</i> covered with Lead, the largest of
which is supported with four Pillars of red Marble variegated, each of
which Pillars measures seven Foot in Circumference. There’s another
<i>Cupola</i> which bears upon four Arches, which are supported with four
Pillars of <i>Thebaic</i> Marble. On the South Side of the fourth Hill there
is erected a Pillar, which nearly resembles that, which was lately,
as I observed, standing in the <i>Exacionion</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span> but is now removed into
the Precinct of the <i>Seraglio</i>. Round the <i>Basis</i> of it there runs a
Wreath of Laurel-work, and the Standard of the Cross, curiously cut in
<i>Basso Relievo</i>. At the Foot of the fifth Hill is a double Wall, which
encloses a Street now called <i>Phanarium</i>, because as the Inhabitants
tell you, when the City was formerly besieged, it was built in the
Space of one Night by Candle-light. I am induced from the Authority
of <i>Dionysius</i> to believe, that <i>Mellacopsas</i> stood near this Street;
the Reason why it was so called I have shewn in my <i>Treatise of the
Bosporus</i>. On the Top of the fifth Hill stands the Palace of <i>Selimus</i>
the <i>Grand Signor</i>, with a <i>Caravansera</i>, and his Tomb. Near it is a
very large <i>Cistern</i>, in a pleasant Meadow, which is despoiled of its
Roof and Pillars.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Sixth Hill, and the Fourteenth</i>
Ward.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Author <i>of the Description of the Wards</i> relates, that the
fourteenth <i>Ward</i>, though it is looked upon as a Part of the City,
yet because it is divided from the other <i>Wards</i> by an intermediate
Space of Land, and enclosed with its own Walls, makes the Figure of a
small City by it self; and adds, among other Particularities, that the
Entrance of it, at the Gate, is somewhat upon the Level; but the right
Side of it, rising into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span> an Ascent, almost to the Middle of the broad
Way, falls into a deep Ascent, and contains a Church, the Palace, <i>&amp;c.</i>
It is very probable, one would think, or at least it looks to be so,
that any one who had never seen <i>Constantinople</i>, could learn from this
Description in what Part of the City stood the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>. But
since, nothing of the antient Buildings are remaining there at present,
no not so much as the Bridge, or the very Channel of the River; there
is some Room for Enquiry, where was the Place of its Situation. For
I am entirely ignorant of the Gate whence its Entrance begins, which
is somewhat upon the Level. It is possible that I might also discover
the Situation of it, if I knew where the right Side of the <i>Ward</i> was,
which rose into an Ascent. ’Tis plain that this <i>Ward</i> did not stand
on the fifth Hill from hence, that the Author tells us, that it was
divided from other <i>Wards</i> by some intermediate Space. Had this <i>Ward</i>
been divided from other <i>Wards</i> by a small Tract of Land only, it had
been very injudicious in the Inhabitants to have enclosed it with a
Wall by it self, when it stood so near the Walls of the City. I would
observe farther, that ’tis inconceivable that there could be any Bridge
on the fifth, sixth, or seventh Hills of the City, or without the Walls
of the City; nor is there any Valley running between the fifth or the
third Hill, where there’s any Bridge, or any Water, unless it can be
imagined that it had any small Creek, which is now filled up, with
a Bridge over it. If it could be supposed that there formerly stood
any Bridge beyond the sixth Hill, in the Street called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span> <i>Avasarius</i>,
we could conclude it to be no other than what was built over the Bay
of <i>Ceras</i>, near which are still seen the Piles of a Bridge. And in
all Probability the sixth Hill was wholly inhabited, by Reason of the
Nearness and Goodness of its Roads from <i>Thrace</i>. This is the more
probable, if it be considered, that the Suburbs called the <i>Hepdomum</i>,
were seated on the sixth Hill, which excited <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>,
by Reason of its Nearness to <i>Constantinople</i> to enlarge the Walls of
the City.</p>

the Place called the</i> Cynegium.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Suburbs, call’d the <i>Hepdomum</i>, stood upon the third Hill, which
is now enclosed within the Walls of the City. This is plain from the
Situation of the Church of St. <i>John Baptist</i>, whom, even at this
Time, the <i>Greeks</i> call the Πρόδρομος, or <i>Fore-runner</i> of
our Saviour. This Church is seated on the Eastern Side of the City.
’Tis almost entirely demolished by the <i>Mahometans</i>, and nothing of it
remains but a few Marble Pillars, expecting the last Effort of their
Sacrilege. This was a costly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span> magnificent Building, as appears,
among other Tokens, from the <i>Cistern</i> of <i>Bonus</i>, which was built by
a Nobleman of that Name, and seated a little above it. It was three
hundred Paces long; its Roof and Columns are entirely ruined, and its
Situation at present is turned into a Garden. <i>Sozomen</i> says, that
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i> brought over the Head of St. <i>John Baptist</i>,
from a Village call’d <i>Coslaus</i>, near <i>Pantichium</i>, in <i>Chalcedon</i>,
and placed it before <i>Constantinople</i> in the <i>Hepdomum</i>, and there
built a large and handsome Church to the Honour of God. The same
Author attests, that <i>Theodosius</i>, when he marched his Army against
<i>Eugenius</i>, as soon as he came out of the City, offered his Prayers
to God, in St. <i>John Baptist</i>’s Church, which he had built in the
<i>Hepdomum</i>. <i>Procopius</i> pays too great a Compliment to <i>Justinian</i>,
when he reports him to have built this Church in the forementioned
Suburbs. <i>Zonaras</i> tells us, that in the Reign of <i>Constantine</i>
surnamed <i>Pogonatus</i>, the <i>Hagarens</i> besieged the City with a numerous
Fleet, which extended itself from the <i>Promontory</i> situated in the
<i>Hepdomum</i> Westward, as far as the <i>Cyclobion</i>. Other <i>Historians</i>
mention the same Thing; namely, that they had their Station from the
said <i>Promontory</i>, or the <i>Triclinium</i> of <i>Magnaura</i>, as far Easterly
as the Palace call’d <i>Cyclobion</i>. From which Passage I would observe
by the By, that <i>Magnaura</i> was a Place in the <i>Hepdomum</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i>
asserts, that <i>Philip</i> of <i>Macedon</i>, built there a round Solar, and
placed in the Court of it his own Statue, and built an Armory there.
Others write, that <i>Mauritius</i> the Emperor built the <i>Triclinium</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> of
<i>Magnaura</i>, and that he erected his Statue, and built the Armory there.
Over the <i>Triclinium</i> are inscribed these Verses;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The <i>Cistern</i> of <i>Magnaura</i>, which stood near the Palace, was
demolished by <i>Heraclius</i>; and, as <i>Cedrinus</i> relates, was afterwards
cleansed, and rebuilt by Order of <i>Philip</i>, King of <i>Macedon</i>. Some
attest, if not consistently with Truth, yet more appositely, that
the Emperor <i>Anastasius</i>, when he was expiring at that Place, by a
terrible Storm of Wind, Lightning and Thunder, cried out with a loud
Voice; <i>Magn&acirc; perimus aur&acirc;</i>. <i>Pulcheria</i> the Sister of <i>Theodosius</i>
the <i>Less</i>, being removed from the Administration of the Government,
retired into the <i>Hepdomum</i>, and lived privately. <i>Zonaras</i> relates,
that <i>Nicephorus</i> the Emperor, surnamed <i>Phocas</i>, as he came near
to the City, was received by the <i>Prasine</i> Faction, with great
Acclamations, and that he was crowned Emperor in the <i>Hepdomum</i> by
the <i>Patriarch</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>. The Reason why those Suburbs are
called the <i>Hepdomum</i>, is taken from the Number <i>Seven</i>, which was
formerly the Number of them. They retained their antient Names, even
after they were inclosed within the City. <i>Procopius</i> has it, that
<i>Justinian</i>, in that <i>Ward</i>, which ought to be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span> the Second,
built a Church to St. <i>Anne</i>. An unknown Writer of the Empire of
<i>Constantinople</i> gives a Reason why it may be called the Second. <i>In
the Place</i>, says he, <i>called the</i> Second, <i>there stood the Statue
of</i> Justinian Rhinometus. Bardus C&aelig;sar Michael, <i>the Grandfather
of</i> Theophilus, <i>demolished and broke it to Pieces</i>. This Place is
called the Second, because when <i>Justinian</i> was banished by <i>Leo</i> the
<i>Patrician</i> to <i>Cherso</i>, after he had continued there ten Years, he
applied himself to <i>Terbelus</i>, King of the <i>Bulgarians</i>, whose Daughter
<i>Theodora</i> he married. The King gave him an Army, which he marched
against <i>Constantinople</i> to recover his Empire. But the Inhabitants
denying him Entrance, he privately stole into the City through the
Passage of an <i>Aqueduct</i> to a Place where was still remaining the
Foundation of a Pillar he had set up, and which his Adversary had
destroyed. Having recovered his Dominions a second Time, he erected
there a second Pillar, and built in the same Place a Church, which
was dedicated to St. <i>Anne</i>. But, as I observed a little before,
<i>Procopius</i> relates, that <i>Justinian</i> built this Church in the second
<i>Ward</i>, where, I am of Opinion, before the Reign of <i>Theodosius</i>
the <i>Less</i>, who built the Walls of the City, stood the Suburbs of
the seventh Hill, that is, according to <i>Cedrinus</i> and others, in
the twelfth <i>Ward</i>. There were, say these Writers, most dreadful
Earthquakes, which overturned the Wall of the City in the <i>Exacionion</i>,
and levell’d many beautiful Houses and magnificent Churches in the
<i>Porta Aurea</i> of the City; and add that in the second <i>Ward</i>, the Shock
was felt as far as St. <i>Anne</i>’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span> Church. I mentioned this Observation
to many of mine Acquaintance, lest any one should imagine that the
δεύτερον χώριον was one of the fourteen <i>Wards</i> mentioned in
the <i>Treatise</i>, entitled, an <i>Antient Description of</i> Constantinople.
I am surprized that <i>Procopius</i>, who was so exact in describing so
many Buildings of the City, never mentions them, since they are taken
Notice of by <i>Justinian</i> in his <i>Constitutions</i>. There’s a Church
situate on the seventh Hill, between the Palace of <i>Constantine</i>, and
the <i>Adrianopolitan Gate</i>, which though for many Ages it stood within
the Walls, yet on three Sides of it, it formerly stood without the
Walls of the City, as it was customary to build the <i>Greek</i> Churches.
There’s a <i>Portico</i> runs round it. The Walls of it within are incrusted
with square Pieces of several Kinds of Marble, the <i>Fissures</i> of which
are covered from Top to Bottom with <i>Modules</i> of <i>Astragals</i>, some of
which are adorned with Berries, and others are work’d round without
them. Above these <i>Incrustations</i> rise three <i>Fasci&aelig;</i>, and three
Ornaments resembling an <i>Astragal</i>, two of which are round, and the
uppermost of them is of a square Figure. Higher yet are three <i>Fasci&aelig;</i>,
above these are the <i>Dentils</i>, and over the <i>Dentils</i>, a <i>Corinthian
Foliage</i>. It will evidently appear from what I shall mention hereafter,
that the Suburbs called the <i>Hepdomum</i>, were in the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>
of the City, where also stood a Palace. There remains at present,
out of many antient Palaces, not so much as the Name of one of them,
except that seated on the seventh Hill, which is called the Palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
<i>Constantine</i>, besides a few Pillars, and a <i>Cistern</i> in which the
Grand <i>Signor</i>’s Elephants are stabled. In the Plain upon the Shore,
situate at the Foot of the sixth Hill Eastward, is the <i>Palatine</i> Gate
called <i>Cynegion</i>. Without the Gate is a fine Growth of Plane-Trees.
Near the Gate, within the Wall, were formerly three large Arches, now
fill’d up, through which the Inhabitants used to sail their Three-oar’d
Galleys, into a Creek built within the City for the Conveniency of the
neighbouring Palace. This Creek is now entirely ruin’d, and turn’d into
a Garden. The <i>Cynegion</i>, according to modern Writers, is a Place of
some Note, so that even <i>Suidas</i> himself thought it not impertinent
to insert in his <i>Lexicon</i> the following Story. <i>Criminals</i>, says he,
<i>condemned to dye were thrown into the</i> Cynegion, <i>which was adorned
with some Statues</i>. Theodorus, <i>the Town-Clerk, going thither with</i>
Imerius <i>Keeper of the Records, saw a short, but a very thick Statue.
Look upon the Man, says</i> Imerius, <i>meaning himself, who built the</i>
Cynegion. <i>I returned in Answer, that</i> Maximinus <i>built it, and that</i>
Aristides <i>measured out the Ground; when immediately one of its Pillars
fell, which crushed</i> Imerius <i>to Pieces, so that he died on the Spot.
Being terrified at the Sight, I hastened to the Church, where I told
what had happened. I attested the Fact with an Oath to those who
questioned the Relation. Some of the Emperor’s Domesticks and Servants,
when their Attendance was over, walked with me to the Place. Being
surprized at the Death of</i> Imerius, <i>and the Fall of the Pillar, a
certain Philosopher named</i> Johannes, <i>told ’em, that he had discovered
from a small Animal, that a Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> of some Note should dye</i>. Philip
<i>of</i> Macedon <i>believing him, ordered the little Creature to be bury’d
in the Place, where this Accident happened</i>. <i>Justinus</i> the <i>Third</i>
commanded <i>Tiberius</i> and <i>Leontius</i>, after they had reign’d three
Years, to have their Chains taken off, ty’d Body to Body, dragged thro’
the <i>Forum</i> and the <i>Theatre</i> by Horses; and after he had trampled upon
the Necks of them, he ordered them to be slain in the <i>Cynegion</i>, in
the Sight of the People. I look upon this <i>Theatre</i> to be that which
was called <i>Theatrum Venatorium</i>. For as there was such a <i>Theatre</i>
at <i>Rome</i>, so there was at <i>Constantinople</i>. For <i>Procopius</i> reports,
that the <i>Theatres</i>, <i>Hippodroms</i>, and the <i>Cynegia</i>, were greatly
neglected, and fell to Ruine, thro’ the Avarice of <i>Justinian</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Author of the Book entitled, <i>The antient Description of the</i> Wards
attests, that there stood in the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>, a Church, but does
not name it; nor does he take Notice of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, although it
was called so before the taking of <i>Constantinople</i> by <i>Severus</i>, as I
shall immediately make appear. The <i>Blachern&aelig;</i> stood without the Walls,
not only in the Time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span> that Book was wrote, but even in the Reign
of <i>Justinian</i>, who, as <i>Procopius</i> writes, built a Church, which he
dedicated to the <i>Virgin Mary</i>, before the Walls of the City, in a
Place called the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>. <i>The Spectator</i>, says he, <i>when he enters
this Church, will admire its large and bulky Building, yet secure
from the Danger of falling by the Strength of its Foundation. You may
behold in it</i>, adds he, <i>a stately Magnificence, without any Mixture of
Gaiety, and too much Embellishment</i>. ’Tis my Opinion, that <i>Justinian</i>
only repaired this Church: For <i>Zonaras</i> reports, that <i>Pulcheria</i>, the
Wife of <i>Marcian</i>, built a Church in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, and dedicated
it to the <i>Virgin Mary</i>. <i>Pomponius L&aelig;tus</i> tells us, that this Church
was built by <i>Theodosius</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, that <i>Justin</i> the Nephew
of <i>Justinian</i>, added two Arches to the Church in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>. So
that ’tis plain from what <i>Procopius</i> has wrote upon this Occasion,
that the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i> stood without the Walls of the City, as it is no
less evident from the Testimony of <i>Agathius</i>. <i>When the barbarous
Nations</i>, says he, <i>approached</i> Constantinople, <i>by the Permission
of</i> Justinian, <i>all the Churches situate without the Walls, from the</i>
Blachern&aelig; <i>to the Black-Sea, were stripp’d of their Armaments, which
were kept within the City</i>. There is at present to be seen, near the
Gate called <i>Xylon</i>, and the Western Angle of the City, between the
Foot of the sixth Hill, and the turning of a Mosque, situate within
the City, (which the People say was dedicated to the <i>Virgin Mary</i>) a
Spring now running, which the <i>Greeks</i> tell us was consecrated to her.
The Place, where the Spring is, is call’d the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> my
first coming to <i>Constantinople</i>, some Remains of it were to be seen,
but now there nothing appears even of its Ruines. From the Bottom of
the sixth Hill, which rises above the Church in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, there
shoots an <i>Aqueduct</i> with two Pipes; one of which is stopp’d with a
Cock, and the other flows in a constant Stream. I took Notice before,
that <i>Andronicus</i> the Emperor brought this <i>Aqueduct</i> from the River
<i>Hydrales</i>, into the <i>Ward</i> of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, where there was no
River Water till his Time. The Emperor <i>Anastasius</i> built the great
<i>Triclinium</i> in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, which went under his Name, even in the
Time of <i>Suidas</i>. <i>Zonaras</i>, and others assure us, that the Emperor
<i>Tiberius</i> built the publick Bath in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>. ’Tis certain
from some modern Histories, that there was in the Time of <i>Zonaras</i>,
even down to the Reign of <i>Manuel</i> the Emperor, an Imperial Palace in
that Place. The Reason why ’tis called the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, is mentioned
by <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i>, in his <i>Navigation of the Bosporus</i>,
from whom I shall just touch upon some Places described by him, which
reach from the Foot of the fifth Hill, to the furthermost Angle of the
City, and the sixth Hill. <i>Beyond Mellacopsas</i>, says he, (this, I took
Notice of before, was at the Foot of the fifth Hill) <i>there are two
Places which afford good Sport in Fishing, all the Year. One upon the
Shallows under the Promontories, the other under the deep hollow Shores
which are never ruffled by the Wind. The first of these is called</i>
Indigenas, <i>from some great Man who was a Native there; the other</i>
Pyracius, <i>from</i> Pyr&aelig;us, <i>a Port of</i> Athens;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span> <i>or as some believe, from
some antient Inhabitant. There’s a Place between them called</i> Cittos,
<i>from the great Plenty of Ivy it produces.</i> There is also a steep Place
called <i>Camara</i>, which adjoins that of <i>Pyracius</i>. ’Tis much exposed to
the Wind, and therefore often feels the Roughness of the Sea. Thence,
up higher, stands <i>Thalassa</i>, which is the Boundary of the <i>Ceratine
Bay</i>, where the Rivers begin to flow into it. ’Tis thus called, either
by Reason of their Nearness to the Sea, whose Salt Waters they mingle
with their Freshness, or because it stands steddy, and more out of
the Wind; or rather, because the constant Influx of the Rivers into
it, brings down daily a muddy Substance into the Sea, which very much
thickens it; though it serves for Nourishment to the Multitudes of Fish
with which it abounds. The first Place that stands upon this calm Sea
is called <i>Polyrrhetius</i>, from a Man named <i>Polyrrhetus</i>: The next is
<i>Vateiascopia</i>, so called from the deep Sea that is about it; a third
is the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, which is a barbarous Word; and the last Place is
the Marshes.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">NOT only some Historians, but also <i>Suidas</i> the Grammarian, have

he was a profess’d Enemy to Images, order’d one <i>Andreas</i> a Statuary,
a Man of some Note in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, to be whipt to Death in the
<i>Hippodrom</i> of St. <i>Mamas</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> tells us, that <i>Mauritius</i> the
Emperor was buried in the Church of St. <i>Mamas</i>, which was built
by <i>Pharasmenes</i>, an Eunuch, and Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to
<i>Justinian</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, that the Church of St. <i>Mamas</i> stood
near the Gate call’d <i>Xylocercon</i>. Others report, That <i>Crunna</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span> King
of the <i>Bulgarians</i>, surrounded <i>Constantinople</i> with an Army from
the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i> to the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, and distrusting the Strength of
his Forces to take the Town, he hasten’d to this Church, set Fire to
a Palace that was near it, and that upon his Retreat, he carry’d off
a Brazen Lyon plac’d in the <i>Hippodrom</i>, a Bear, a Dragon, and some
curious Pieces of Marble. <i>Sozomen</i> speaking of those Persons who were
banish’d on St. <i>Chrysostom</i>’s Account, says, that when they were got
without the Walls they met in a Place situate before the City, which
<i>Constantine</i> order’d to be cleans’d, to be pal’d round, and made it
into a <i>Hippodrom</i>. This, I take it, was the Place which was afterwards
call’d the <i>Hippodrom</i> of St. <i>Mamas</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> adds upon this
Occasion, that <i>Leo</i> the Emperor, scar’d by a Fire, which then rag’d
in the City, flew to the Church of St. <i>Mamas</i>, and continu’d there
for some Time. <i>Cedrinus</i> mentions, that the Emperor diverted himself
with Horse-racing, near the Church of St. <i>Mamas</i> the Martyr, situate
in the <i>Stenon</i>. ’Tis plain from the Authorities abovemention’d,
that this Church was seated in the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, and that there was a
Bridge there, as is farther confirm’d by <i>Johannes Tzetzes</i> in his
<i>Vari&acirc; Histori&acirc;</i>, where he says, that the Sea extending itself from
the Streights of <i>Abydus</i>, to the Bridge of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, is call’d
the <i>Hellespont</i>. ’Tis also evident, that this Bridge stood, where
the Stone Piles of the old Bridge (when the Water is low, as ’tis in
Summer) are seen at present, and stand between the Suburbs call’d the
<i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, and the Suburbs, which the <i>Turks</i> call the <i>Aibasarium</i>.
This, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span> am confident, is the same Bridge which the ancient Treatise
<i>of the Wards of the City</i>, calls the Wooden Bridge, and places it in
the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>, in which, as I observ’d, was the Suburbs call’d
the <i>Hepdomum</i>. I desire the Reader to remark one Thing from <i>Suidas</i>,
that St. <i>Mamas</i> Bridge had either twelve Stone Arches, or else, that
he was writing of another Church of St. <i>Mamas</i>, situate in another
Place.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the seventh Hill, the twelfth Ward,
and of the Pillar of</i> Arcadius.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">I Take it for granted, from the Situation of the Pillar of <i>Arcadius</i>,
now standing on the seventh Hill, call’d the <i>Xerolophon</i>, (which
is divided from the other six Hills by a broad Valley,) that That
is the twelfth <i>Ward</i>, which lies a great Way upon the Level, from
the Entrance of the City at the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, and is lengthen’d, on
the Left Side of it, by a gentle Descent, and bounded by the Sea. It
contain’d the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, the <i>Trojan Portico’s</i>, the <i>Forum</i>, and
Haven of <i>Theodosius</i>, and a Pillar with winding Steps in the Inside,
built in the <i>Xerolophon</i> by <i>Arcadius</i>. The Hill still preserves
the same Name. Upon this Pillar the Emperor plac’d his Statue, which
was thrown down, in the Reign of <i>Leo Conon</i> by an Earthquake, which
shook the whole City, overturn’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span> many Churches and Houses, and buried
Multitudes of People under it. <i>Cedrinus</i> assures us, that this
Pillar was in all respects like that of <i>Theodosius</i> erected in the
<i>Taurus</i>. It has a <i>Base</i>, a <i>Pedestal</i>, and a <i>Capital</i>. The <i>Shaft</i>
of the Pillar, with its <i>Pedestal</i> and <i>Capital</i>, consists of twenty
one Stones. Above the <i>Capital</i> are two Stones. The <i>Pedestal</i> alone
is built with five Stones, so closely cemented together, that if the
Pillar had never felt the Shocks of an Earth-quake, or the Decays of
Time, it had appear’d to have been one entire Stone. These Stones are
plac’d one above another, and are hollow in the Inside. Each of them
is the whole Compass of the Pillar, out of which are cut the Steps and
Windows which beautify and enlighten it. I took upon me to measure the
Compass of the <i>Shaft</i> from the Stone which covers it at Top, down to
the lowest Step of the <i>Pedestal</i>. This Stone therefore, thro’ which
there is cut a Door, by which you ascend above the <i>Abacus</i> of the
<i>Capital</i>, is about thirteen Foot nine Inches high, and is itself the
Roof and Arch of the whole Pillar. The Door is six Foot two Digits
high, and three Foot nine Inches broad. The second Stone is six Foot
high, in which is cut the uppermost Step above the <i>Abacus</i> of the
<i>Capital</i>. The third is five Foot and four Digits high, and contains
the <i>Abacus</i> and the whole <i>Capital</i>. The fifth is five Foot in
height, wanting two Digits. The Sixth is four Foot nine Inches high.
The Seventh five Foot and two Digits. The Eighth four Foot and four
Digits. The Ninth is six Foot high. The Tenth five Foot. The Eleventh
four Foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span> and fourteen Digits. The Twelfth four Foot nine Inches.
The Thirteenth five Foot. The Fourteenth five Foot two Digits. The
fifteenth five Foot and a half. The Sixteenth the same. The Seventeenth
five Foot and ten Digits. The eighteenth six Foot and a half. The
Nineteenth five Foot and four Digits. The Twentieth six Foot and a
half. The Twenty first, where the <i>Shaft</i> of the Pillar begins, six
Foot and four Digits high. The <i>Pedestal</i> consists of six Stones. The
uppermost of which is four Foot nine Inches high. The Second is the
same height. The Third four Foot. The Fourth four Foot six Inches. The
Fifth the same. The Sixth and last is four Foot high. It has in all
fifty six Windows, and two hundred thirty three Steps of two kinds.
For some rise in square, others in circular Windings, after the Manner
of some Shell-Fish. You ascend the <i>Pedestal</i> by five square Winding
Steps. Every Winding has at the Top of it a small Floor, which leads
you from one Winding to another. The first and second Windings have
six Steps each; the third eight; the fourth and fifth, nine each; the
lowest of them all, which lies level with the Threshold of the Door, is
ten Digits high, twelve Inches broad, and two Foot nine Inches long.
The other square Windings are like this, and the Floor at the Top of
each of them is two Foot nine Inches square. Upon the fifth Winding
stands the <i>Shaft</i> of the Pillar, the first Steps of which are ten
Digits high; near the Wall they are a Foot broad, in the Middle a Foot
and nine Inches, and in Length they are two Foot nine Inches. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Steps above them, are all of them, nine Digits high. The Inside of the
<i>Shaft</i> of the Pillar measures twenty eight Foot in Circumference. The
Wall which encloses the Steps, in the lowest Part of it, is two Foot
and three Digits, in the highest, ’tis one Foot nine Inches thick. If
I should be thought too curious, in taking the Dimensions of every
Stone, this Character with more Justice belongs to that Man, (and yet
<i>Thucydides</i> highly commends him for it) who by counting the Rows of
Bricks of which they were built, took the height of the Enemies Walls.
I was under some Apprehensions from the Savageness of the Inhabitants,
lest they should catch me dropping my Line, had I measur’d it without,
so that I lay under a Necessity of taking the Dimensions within; and by
joining the height of one Stone to the height of another, I discover’d
its Altitude. There are two Steps consisting of many Stones, which
first shew themselves from the Surface of the Earth. Above them is the
third Step, which is cut out of a Stone three Foot and four Digits
high, and thirty three Foot and a half in Circumference. Upon the Stone
which makes the third Step, stands the <i>Pedestal</i>. The first of the
five Stones of which it consists, from the Threshold of the Door, is
five Foot and a half high. Its Ornaments are a plain <i>Plinth</i> three
Foot five Digits high, a small <i>Tore</i> five Digits high, an <i>Apophyge</i>
with a <i>Reglet</i> nine Inches, another <i>Reglet</i> above it two Digits,
and a <i>Cornice</i> engrav’d, which is nine Inches high. The <i>Frieze</i>, on
three Sides, is curiously engrav’d with Trophies; the Northern Side of
it, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span> the Door is, is not engrav’d at all. The <i>Cornice</i> of the
Pedestal bends downwards. At the bottom of it is a <i>Reglet</i>, above that
an <i>Astragal</i>, adorn’d with Berries; then an <i>Ovolo</i>, and above that
an <i>Astragal</i> wreath’d like a Rope. Higher yet is a <i>Folial</i> Bandage.
There projects beyond the <i>Pedestal</i> a kind of <i>Abacus</i>; on each side
of which there are two <i>Fasces</i> of Laurel-work, the largest of which
is incurvated even to the bottom of the <i>Abacus</i>. On the Sides of this
<i>Abacus</i> there is a Sculpture of seven naked Boys, holding each of them
in his Hand a Laureated <i>Fascis</i>. At every Angle of this <i>Abacus</i> there
stands an Eagle, and above it is the <i>Plinth</i> of the Pillar, adorn’d
with a <i>Foliage</i>, which projects very little. Above the <i>Plinth</i> is
a <i>Tore</i>, adorn’d with Laurel-work, which is filletted with a spiral
Bandage. Above the <i>Tore</i> there rises an <i>Apophyge</i>, upon which Stands
the Shaft of the Pillar, which is carv’d with the Scenes of War, and
of Battles. The Sculpture is much like that which adorns the Pillar of
<i>Trajan</i> in Old <i>Rome</i>. The <i>Trachelium</i>, or Top of the <i>Shaft</i>, is
fluted perpendicularly. The lower part of its <i>Capital</i> is adorn’d with
<i>Apophyges</i>, an <i>Ovolo</i>, and an <i>Abacus</i>, which projects beyond the
<i>Shaft</i> two Foot and fourteen Digits. The <i>Abacus</i>, on all sides of it,
is seventeen Foot, and nine Inches round. Above the <i>Abacus</i> there is a
Door, above which the Pillar rises in the Form of a <i>Cone</i>, where there
is another Door above ten Foot high. We may look upon this Pillar to be
of the <i>Tuscan</i> Order, because both the <i>Base</i>, and the <i>Capital</i> of
it, are finished after the <i>Tuscan</i> manner.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Statues, and the antient</i> Tripos
<i>of</i> Apollo, <i>standing in the</i> Xerolophon.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>SUIDAS</i> writes, that the <i>Xerolophon</i> was formerly call’d <i>Thema</i>,
because it was a kind of Repository, and contained in it fifteen
winding Apartments, the Statue of <i>Diana</i>, and <i>Severus</i>, who built
it; besides a <i>Thermation</i>, a <i>Tripos</i> from whence many Oracles were
deliver’d. In this Place, the Founder of it us’d to offer Sacrifices;
and among others he sacrificed a Virgin. <i>Priscian</i>, whom I find
mention’d by <i>Benedictus &AElig;gius</i>, indefatigably curious in his Search of
Antiquity, observes, That the <i>Azoles</i> sometimes inserted in a Word the
Letter Ϝ, as I have taken Notice of in some Inscriptions of a
very antient <i>Tripos</i> of <i>Apollo</i>, still remaining in the <i>Xerolophon</i>;
the Words of which are written after this Manner; Δημοφάϝων,
Λαϝονάϝων. He tells us, that ’tis customary in another Place,
meaning among the <i>&AElig;olians</i>, to place an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ϝ</span> between two
Vowels of the same Word; as in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄϝις</span>, <i>ovis</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δάϝος</span>,
<i>Davus</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὦϝον</span>, <i>ovum</i>. I have seen, says he, the same in some
old Inscriptions, in very antient Characters, on some <i>Tripos’s</i>,
especially on the <i>Tripos</i> of <i>Apollo</i>, which is at <i>Constantinople</i>;
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημοφόϝων</span> for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημοφόων</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λαϝοκόϝων</span> for
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λαοκόων</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span> Others add, that there were the like Insertions
in the <i>Xerolophon</i>, a little above the <i>Basis</i> of the Pillars of
<i>Marcian</i>, <i>Valentinian</i>, and <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> tells
us, that <i>Simeon</i>, a Prince of the <i>Bulgarians</i>, a Man of a cruel and
turbulent Spirit, march’d an Army against the <i>Chrobatians</i>; when he
was conquer’d, and lost his Army, partly by the Badness of the Roads,
some Body inform’d the Emperor that the Statue plac’d above the Arch
in the <i>Xerolophon</i>, looking Westward, was carv’d for the Statue of
<i>Simeon</i> of <i>Bulgaria</i>, and that if any one cut off the Head of the
Statue, <i>Simeon</i> should immediately die. The Emperor commands the Head
of the Statue to be chopt off, and soon received the News that <i>Simeon</i>
was dead of a violent Pain of the Stomach. For he watch’d to a Minute
the Time of his Death. As to the Port of <i>Theodosius</i>, that was in the
same Place where the Gardens, which are now call’d the <i>Blancha</i>, stand
at present. These Gardens are enclos’d with a Wall, and are seated in
a Plain, adjoyning to the Shore of the <i>Propontis</i>, at the Foot of the
sixth Hill. The Mouth of the Port stood Eastward, from whence the Pier
extended it self Westward, in a direct Line, where at present stand
the Walls of the City. The Pier was twelve Foot in Thickness; and, as
I found by walking it, ’twas six Hundred of my Paces in length. ’Tis
now entirely ruin’d. The Gardens, which are very spacious, abound with
Sallets and Potherbs, but have very few Fruit-Trees. These Gardens
are water’d with Pools, which they have within them, and which are
the Remains of the old Port. I discover’d by the Pier, and Situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
of the Place, that ’twas above a Mile in compass. In the Mouth of the
Port, not altogether unfit for Ships at present, without the City
Wall, you still see a Fortress in its Ruins, surrounded by the Sea.
The unknown Writer of <i>the Empire</i> of <i>Constantinople</i> asserts, That
it was first called <i>Thema</i>, afterwards the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>;
tho’ it seems to me rather to be the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Arcadius</i>, by Reason
the Pillar of <i>Arcadius</i> joyns to it. For the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Theodosius</i>,
in all Probability, stood near the Port of <i>Theodosius</i>. This is no
more than what is conformable to the Rules of Architecture, which
prescribe, that a Market should be built near a Port. I am of Opinion,
that it was formerly call’d the Port of <i>Eleutherius</i>, if we may credit
those Writers who affirm, That <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> built a Wall
from the Ridge of the first Hill to the Port of <i>Sophia</i>, and the Port
of <i>Eleutherius</i>, built by <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, to prevent the
Inundations of the Sea. ’Tis called the Port of <i>Eleutherius</i>, because,
when ’twas built, he was Surveyor of the Works. It was for this Reason,
that there was a Marble Statue erected to him in that Port, bearing
on his Shoulders a Basket of Marble, and holding in his Hand a Marble
Spade. They add further, that <i>Irena</i>, and her Son <i>Constantine</i>, built
him a noble Seat; and that from that Seat, as far as the <i>Amastrianum</i>,
reach’d the <i>Hippodrom</i>, which was built by <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>,
and was demolish’d by <i>Irena</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, that <i>Irena</i>, after
she was remov’d from the Government by <i>Constantine</i> her Son, liv’d in
a House which she built in the Port of <i>Eleutherius</i>. The <i>Portico’s</i>,
which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span> <i>ancient Description of the Wards of the City</i> names with
the Epithet <i>Troade&aelig;</i>, others mention with that of <i>Troadesi&aelig;</i>, and
tell us, that <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i> built the Walls of the City
as far as the <i>Portico’s</i> call’d <i>Porticus Troadesi&aelig;</i> (that is, the
<i>Trojan Portico’s</i>) and the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, which stood in the twelfth
<i>Ward</i>. I am of Opinion, that they were call’d the <i>Trojan Portico’s</i>,
because they contain’d some Things of the like Kind with that which
was called the <i>Porticus Varia</i>. ’Tis reported, says he, that in
the <i>Portico</i>, formerly call’d <i>Plesiactia</i>, and now <i>P&aelig;cilla</i>, or
<i>Porticus Varia</i>, a celebrated Painter drew the Face of <i>Laodice</i>, on
the Picture of <i>Elpinica</i>. I had not known it by the Name it goes at
present, had it not been for a Spring near it which they call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χρυσοπηγὴ</span>, as deriving its Name from the <i>Porta Aurea</i>. This Spring,
to this Day, constantly flows, and is drank with great Devotion by the
<i>Greeks</i>, who hold all Springs, near their Churches, to be sacred.
There’s nothing of the Church remaining at present, tho’ <i>Procopius</i>
takes Notice of it. <i>Justinian</i>, says he, <i>built two Churches to the</i>
Virgin Mary, <i>before the Walls of the City one in the</i> Blachern&aelig;,
<i>the other in a Place call’d</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πηγὴ</span>, <i>where there is a large
Wood of Cypresses, a verdant Meadow, and a delightful Garden, which
produces a great Store of fine Fruit, and where there is also a gentle
Spring, which affords very good drinking Water. One of the Churches
stood near the Sea-shore, the other near the</i> Porta Aurea. <i>Both of
them</i>, he adds, <i>were near the end of the City Walls, and were upon
Occasion impregnable Fortresses to it</i>. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span> hence I would remark,
that in the Time of <i>Justinian</i>, the Angle of the City, which they call
the Angle of the seven Towers, was not within the City; but that the
Land-wall from the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, straitned the Angle of the City into
a more narrow Compass, as appears from the Situation of the Monastery
of <i>Studius</i>, which stood upon a piece of Ground, which was formerly
look’d upon to be in the Suburbs, but now stands further within the
Walls, than the Angle of the seven Towers. He proceeds, and tells us,
that <i>Justinian</i>, at a vast Expence, upon the Entrance of the <i>Porta
Aurea</i> on the right Hand, rebuilt the Temple of <i>Ja</i>, (which Time
had wholly defac’d) for the Service of the True <span class="smcap">God</span>. The
Observation I would make from hence is, that the <i>Porta Aurea</i> stood
near the seventh Hill, call’d the <i>Xerolophon</i>, which is also confirm’d
by <i>Zonaras</i>, who writes, That in the Time of <i>Leo</i>, many Churches
and Houses, the Statue of <i>Arcadius</i>, plac’d upon a Pillar in the
<i>Xerolophon</i>, and the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>, placed upon
the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, as also the City Walls, reaching to the Continent on
the Field side, were overthrown by an Earthquake. <i>Cedrinus</i> asserts,
that the Statue of <i>Victory</i>, near the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, was overturn’d
by the same Earthquake. Other Historians mention, that by the same
Earthquake, which happen’d the Vᵗʰ of the <i>Calends</i> of <i>November</i>,
many sacred Buildings, and many others of common Use, with Multitudes
of People, were destroy’d; and that the Statue of <i>Constantine</i> the
<i>Great</i>, which stood upon the Gate of <i>Attalus</i>, with the Gate it self,
was demolish’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span> by it. It is therefore a great Mistake in those, who
take the <i>Porta Aurea</i> to be the same Gate which is now call’d <i>Oria</i>,
and is seated in the Northern Part of the City, which, as I observ’d
before, was called the Port of <i>Neorius</i>, since ’tis plain from what
I have mentioned, that the <i>Porta Aurea</i> was in the Western Part of
the City. This is also evident from the <i>antient Description</i> of the
<i>Wards</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, which tells us, that the Length of the
City, from the <i>Porta Aurea</i> to the Sea-shore, in a direct Line, is
fourteen Thousand and seventy five Feet. <i>Cedrinus</i> takes Notice, that
the Elephants stabled in the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, were much of that Kind,
with which <i>Theodosius</i> made his publick Entry into the City. ’Tis
said that <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i> who built the Walls of the City
as far as the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, brought the Statues of those Elephants,
which are plac’d upon the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, from the Temple of <i>Mars</i> at
<i>Athens</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i> asserts, that <i>Philip</i> King of <i>Macedon</i> built
the great Church of <i>Mocius</i> the Martyr, and a Church to St. <i>Anne</i> in
a Place call’d <i>Secundus</i>. <i>Procopius</i> says, that both these Churches
were built by <i>Justinian</i>. I have seen some Remains of the Church of
<i>Mocius</i>, near a large <i>Cistern</i>, built by <i>Justinian</i>, on the Top of
the seventh Hill. All its Pillars are standing, and it goes still under
the Name of <i>Mocius</i>. Some Historians, and <i>Suidas</i> the <i>Grammarian</i>
say, that this <i>Cistern</i> was built by <i>Anastasius Dicorus</i>. It may be
worth Enquiry, whether the <i>Moneta</i>, which the <i>antient Description
of the Wards</i> places in this Ward, was the Temple of <i>Juno Moneta</i>,
or the Treasury. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span> the <i>Grand Seignor</i>, to this Day, makes use of
the Castle with seven Towers for a Treasury. <i>Suidas</i> writes, that the
Statue of <i>Juno</i> was supported by a Brazen Arch, made somewhat in Form
of a Pair of Barbers Scissars, but takes no Notice where it stood; so
that I desire the Reader would lay no great Stress upon what I have
said of the <i>Moneta</i>.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Columns now remaining on the
Seventh Hill.</i></span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE Church standing here is called <i>Studios</i>, because it was built by
one <i>Studius</i> an eminent Citizen of <i>Constantinople</i>. It was he, says
<i>Suidas</i>, who built this Church with a handsome Monastery. <i>Justinian</i>,
in his <i>Constitutions</i>, takes Notice of him, when he says, That there
were two Biers plac’d in the sacred Treasury; one to the Memory of
the Famous <i>Studius</i>, and the other to the Memory of the Magnificent
<i>Stephanus</i>. The Monastery built by <i>Studius</i> was call’d <i>Studium</i>,
which is entirely demolish’d. The Church remains, tho’ converted
into a Mosque. In its Porch are four Pillars with a <i>Trabeation</i>
curiously finish’d. In the Inside of the Mosque, there are on each
side seven green Pillars, streak’d with black Veins, and look as if
they were inlay’d with Pieces of Stone of another kind. Each of them
measures in Circumference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span> six Foot and six Digits. Their <i>Capitals</i>,
and <i>Architraves</i>, are finish’d after the <i>Corinthian</i> Manner, as
are those which stand in the <i>Vestibule</i>. In the upper Part of it
stands another Order of six Pillars. In the Courts of the Mosque is a
<i>Cistern</i>; the Roof of it, which is Brick-work, is supported by twenty
three lofty <i>Corinthian</i> Pillars. The Monastery of <i>Studius</i> is now
within the Walls of the City, tho’ it formerly stood without it, near
the way you go from the Pillar of <i>Arcadius</i> to the Gate of the seven
Towers. The Passage of this Gate is at present fill’d up; the Jambs
of it are two <i>Corinthian</i> Pillars of spotted Marble, streak’d with
green Veins, which sustain eight smaller Pillars, which support three
Arches above. On the left Side of the Gate are six Marble Tables, all
of which are enclos’d, some with round, some with square Pilasters,
upon which are carv’d many fine Statues. They are all of them Naked,
of exquisite Workmanship, in a fighting Posture, with Clubs in their
Hands, the tallest of which have engrav’d over them winged <i>Cupids</i>.
On the right Side of the Gate are six more Tables, enclos’d as the
former. Upon the lowest of these there lies a young Man, with his
Face upwards, and his Legs folded, holding a musical Instrument in
his Hand. There hangs over him a little Figure, in the Likeness of a
<i>Cupid</i>, and above the <i>Cupid</i> there rises a Woman. Upon the highest
Table there’s carved a naked Statue, with a Club in his Hand; his
right Arm is cover’d with a Lyon’s Skin, and with his left Hand he is
leading Dogs. Above him is the Statue of a Lyoness with full Dugs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Upon another Table are carv’d two Husbandmen carrying Baskets full of
Grapes; and upon another is the Statue of a flying Horse. The Bridle is
held by a Woman, behind whom stand two Women more: At the Top of the
Table there’s another Woman in a recumbent Posture, and opposite to
her a young Man lying on the Ground. I took particular Notice of these
Figures, by Reason of the Antiquity, and the admirable Sculpture of
them. I saw also upon the seventh Hill, among others, four Mosques of
curious Workmanship. Their <i>Vestibules</i> and Pillars were all of Marble.
Three of them stood on the Eastern Side of the Hill, two of whose
<i>Vestibules</i> were adorn’d with six lofty and large Pillars; two of
which were of <i>Thebean</i> Marble, and the other four of different kinds
of Marble, vein’d with a dark green. The other stands near the Pillar
of <i>Arcadius</i>, lately built by the Consort of <i>Solyman</i> the <i>Grand
Seignor</i>, (with a handsome <i>Caravansera</i>, and a College, where the
<i>Turkish</i> and <i>Arabian</i> Learning is profess’d) in which I counted more
than sixty Pillars of different kinds. On the Top of the Hill there are
two other Mosques, one of which has <i>Bagnio’s</i>, and Colleges joyning to
it. The <i>Vestibule</i> of it is beautify’d with six Pillars of <i>Thebean</i>
Marble, which measure each six Foot in Circumference. Their <i>Bases</i> and
<i>Capitals</i> are finish’d after the <i>Turkish</i> Manner. The <i>Shafts</i> of
the Pillars are very ancient, especially of those two which face the
Door of the Mosque, whose <i>Hypotrachelions</i> at Top are more slender
than the <i>Shafts</i>, tho’ in the lower Parts of them, they are equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
them, as a Man’s Neck is less in Circumference near the Head, than the
Shoulders. ’Tis adorn’d with one <i>Annulet</i>, which rises in the manner
of a Ring. Above it there’s another <i>Annulet</i>, which is broad and flat.
I saw no <i>Hypotrachelion</i>, all the Time I was at <i>Constantinople</i>,
which came so near the Model of <i>Vitruvius</i>, as this; who delivers it
as his Judgment, that the <i>Hypotrachelion</i> ought to be contracted in
the upper Part of it, as you may see in his third Book <i>de Ionicis</i>.
There’s another Mosque on the same Hill, the <i>Vestibule</i> of which is
beautify’d with six very lofty Pillars; in the College Court there are
fourteen, and as many in a <i>Portico</i> adjoyning to it.</p>

<span class="inblk"><i>Of the Thirteenth</i> Ward <i>of the City, call’d
the</i> Sycene Ward, <i>of the Town of</i>
Galata, <i>sometimes nam’d</i> Pera.</span></h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Antient Description of the Wards of the City</i> takes Notice, that
<i>Galata</i> was formerly a Part of the City. The Thirteenth <i>Ward</i> of <i>New
Rome</i>, says the Author, is the <i>Sycene Ward</i>, which is divided from it
by a narrow Bay, and preserves an Intercourse with it, by Boats and
Shipping. It is seated on the Side of a Hill, except a broad Tract
of Land at the Foot of it, which lies upon the Level. <i>Stephanus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
says, that the Town of <i>Syc&aelig;</i> was situated against <i>New Rome</i>, and
that it was call’d in his Time <i>Syc&aelig; Justinian&aelig;</i>, but does not give
the Reason why it was call’d so. Probably it was, because <i>Justinian</i>
either repair’d or rebuilt it; for which Reasons principally Cities
frequently change their Names. I wonder that <i>Procopius</i> never took
Notice of this Place, since he has given us an exact Description of all
the Edifices of the Bay, call’d the <i>Chrysoceras</i>, which were either
built or repair’d by him; unless perhaps the Mistake be in <i>Procopius</i>,
by inserting the Word <i>Jucundian&aelig;</i> instead of <i>Justinian&aelig;</i>, when he
tells us, that <i>Justinian</i> rebuilt the Palaces of the Suburbs in the
<i>Chalcopratia</i>, as also in the Place call’d <i>Syc&aelig; Jucundian&aelig;</i>. If
the Fault be not in <i>Procopius</i>, ’tis an Errour of <i>Stephanus</i>, who
writes <i>Justinian&aelig;</i> for <i>Jucundian&aelig;</i>. But ’tis plain, that <i>Stephanus</i>
wrote long before the Time of <i>Justinian</i>; so that if there be any
Blunder, ’tis none of <i>Stephanus</i>, but <i>Hermolaus</i>, a Grammarian of
<i>Constantinople</i>, who abridg’d the Commentaries of <i>Stephanus</i>, and
dedicated them to <i>Justinian</i>. If I might give my Opinion, I should
rather call it <i>Syc&aelig; Justinian&aelig;</i>, than <i>Jucundian&aelig;</i>, because it
appears to me it should be so, not only by comparing some Books of
<i>Procopius</i> and <i>Justinian</i> which have been publish’d, but also by the
Authorities of several MSS. <i>Justinian</i> asserts in his <i>Constitutions</i>,
<i>That ’tis agreeable to Equity, if a Corpse be carried to the Grave
to a great Distance, that the Deacons attending it, should have some
Acknowledgment</i>. He subjoyns a little after, <i>That he is of the same
Opinion, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span> Corpse be bury’d within the new Walls of the City
or this Side of the</i> Syc&aelig; Justinian&aelig;. This is but a small Procession,
and it requires not much Time or Pains to walk thither; <i>but</i>, says
he, <i>if the Body be carried beyond the Walls of this flourishing City,
or beyond any other Stairs, than those which lead to</i> Syc&aelig;——There’s
no Occasion to add what follows. I would only have the Reader observe,
that the Word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέρασμα</span> which the <i>Latins</i> interpret <i>Terminus</i>,
or a Boundary, signifies properly <i>Trajectus</i>, a Ferry, or the <i>Stairs</i>
from whence you sail from one Place to another. ’Tis evident, from what
I have quoted, that the Town call’d <i>Syc&aelig;</i> is on the other side of
the Bay facing <i>Constantinople</i>, altho’ <i>Stephanus</i> has not declar’d
against what Part of the City it lies. I observe notwithstanding from
the <i>Treatise</i> above mention’d, that the sixth <i>Ward</i> reach’d from
the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i> to the Ferry against <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, which is
now call’d the Ferry of <i>Pera</i>, or <i>Galata</i>. As I would pay a just
Regard to the Authorities of some more modern Historians, I hall
produce several Testimonies from them. They assert, that <i>Absimarus</i>,
the Commander in Chief of the Forces which besieg’d <i>Constantinople</i>,
harbour’d in the Port of <i>Syc&aelig;</i> against the City. <i>Evagrius</i> writes,
that the Heads of <i>Longinus</i>, and <i>Theodorus</i>, stuck upon Poles,
were sent to <i>Constantinople</i> by <i>Johannes</i> a <i>Scythian</i>, and by the
Emperor’s Command were fix’d upon the Shore of <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, opposite to
<i>Constantinople</i>; a pleasant Spectacle to the Inhabitants of the City!
He adds further, That <i>Vitalianus</i> made an Incursion as far as <i>Syc&aelig;</i>,
and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> when he came to an Anchor there, the Emperor <i>Anastasius</i>
sent <i>Marinus</i> an <i>Assyrian</i> Admiral to fight him. Both Fleets prepare
for the Engagement; the one facing <i>Constantinople</i>, the other <i>Syc&aelig;</i>.
For some Time they kept their Stations; after some small Skirmishes,
and Attacks on both Sides, the Fight began near the Places call’d the
<i>Vitharia</i>. <i>Vitalianus</i> having lost most of his Men, was forced to
bear off, so that there was not the least Appearance of an Enemy in all
the <i>Bosporus</i>. Nor am I induc’d to change my Opinion by the Authority
of <i>Strabo</i>, who seems to place <i>Syc&aelig;</i> at some Distance from the Bay.
<i>The</i> Bosporus, says he, <i>straitning it self from the Promontory into
the Measure of five</i> Stadia, <i>or Furlongs, widens at the Harbour plac’d
below</i> Syc&aelig; <i>into thirty Furlongs, and from</i> Syc&aelig; <i>to the</i> Chrysoceras
<i>it contracts it self again into five Furlongs</i>. Nor would this Opinion
any ways contradict what I have said before, if my Author had meant by
the <i>Ceras</i> of the <i>Byzantians</i>, what <i>Pliny</i> ’tis plain did, <i>viz.</i>
the <i>Bosporian Promontory</i> where <i>Byzantium</i> stood. But <i>Strabo</i>
immediately subjoins, that the <i>Ceras</i> was a Bay which was sixty
Furlongs in length; and therefore it appears to me, that the Mistake
lies either in <i>Cod. Strabon.</i> or in the Historian himself, as is fully
evident from the Authority of <i>Dionysius</i>, a very ancient Writer of the
History of <i>Constantinople</i>, which was his Native Place. This Author
has recorded it, that <i>Sycodes</i>, or <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, is the same Place near the
Bay call’d <i>Ceras</i>, where <i>Galata</i> stands at present, as I have more
evidently shewn in my <i>Treatise of the Bosporus</i>. The People of <i>Pera</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
therefore are grosly in the wrong, when they tell us, that <i>Pera</i> was
first built by the <i>Genoese</i>; when it is plain that <i>Pera</i> was built
long before they were suppos’d either to have purchas’d the Town,
or to have receiv’d it as a Reward of their Sea-Services, from some
Emperor of <i>Constantinople</i>; since <i>Justinian</i> places <i>Syc&aelig;</i> within
the Walls of the City, and <i>Agathius</i> assures us, it was enclosed with
Walls, when he writes, that the People of <i>Constantinople</i> were in
such a Consternation upon the Approach of the Enemy, that the Forces
of <i>Justinian</i> were obliged to climb the Walls of <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, to make a
more vigorous Defence. <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, by <i>Stephanus</i>, is call’d a City, as it
is also by some modern Writers; but more antient Authors, who liv’d
before <i>Galata</i> was taken by the <i>Genoese</i>, call it the Cittadel of
<i>Galata</i>. They tell us farther, that a Fleet of the <i>Saracens</i> was
station’d from the <i>Magnaura</i> to the <i>Cyclobion</i>; and that after it had
continu’d two Days in that Station, Part of it was driven by a Storm to
the Cittadel of <i>Galata</i>, as far as the <i>Clydion</i>, where the Emperor
of <i>Constantinople</i> destroy’d it, from <i>Acropolis</i>, with liquid Fire.
<i>Zonaras</i> writes, that when <i>Michael</i> the Emperor was besieged both by
Sea and Land, he was so terribly distrest, that he was forc’d to lay a
Boom across the Sea from <i>Acropolis</i>, to a small Town on the opposite
Shore. There is at this Day a Gate at <i>Galata</i>, which is call’d the
<i>Boom-Gate</i>. ’Tis however beyond Dispute, that <i>Galata</i> was more than
once enlarg’d by the <i>Genoese</i>: This appears from the Walls, which at
several Times they have built about it, being fortified on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span> East by
Double, and on the West by Treble Walls, denoting the gradual Increase
of the Town. You may see at present the antient <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, enclos’d in the
middle of <i>Galata</i>, situate against the sixth <i>Ward</i>, and the <i>Sycene</i>
Ferry, all built on the Side of a Hill, just as ’tis represented in
the <i>Antient Description</i> of the <i>Wards</i>, except one broad Piece of
Ground, which lies upon a Level on the Shore at the Foot of the Hill.
This Tract of Land was at least a hundred <i>Roman</i> Paces broad. For at
present, between the Hill and the Bay, there is a Plain to be seen of
an equal, if not of a larger Breadth; because, in such a Length of
Time, it is widen’d, as may be observ’d daily, by the Abundance of
Filth and Nastiness, which is cast about it. To make it subside at the
Bottom, the Inhabitants have fix’d wooden Troughs upon Piles, which
they drive into the Earth by an Engine, much like a Rammer. By this
Means the Plain upon the Shore is enlarg’d, and made more commodious
for Havens. But that the Reader may understand more perfectly where
the <i>Sycene Ward</i> stood formerly, I will describe the Situation of
<i>Galata</i>, as it stands at present.</p>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>Sycene Ward</i>, which is commonly called <i>Galata</i>, or <i>Pera</i>,
ought more properly to be called the <i>Per&aelig;an Ward</i>. Thus it is that
<i>Josephus</i> calls <i>Jud&aelig;a</i>, because it lay on the <i>other Side</i> of the
River <i>Jordan</i>: And thus it is, that <i>Strabo</i> calls that Part of the
Countrey which lies on the <i>other Side</i> of <i>Euphrates</i>. The Reason
alledg’d by the Inhabitants, why ’tis call’d <i>Galata</i>, is, as they
tell you, (being impos’d upon by the Allusion of the Name) that <i>Milk</i>
was formerly sold there: And I make no Question of it, did they but
know, that <i>Galata</i> was formerly call’d <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, they would derive its
Name from the Word <i>Fig</i>; and pretend to justify their Mistake from
the Authority of <i>Dionysius</i> their Countryman, who says, that it was
originally call’d <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, from the Fairness and Abundance of that
Fruit which grew there. But their Conjectures had been grounded upon a
better Foundation, if they had deriv’d the Name of <i>Galata</i> from the
<i>Galat&aelig;</i>, back’d by the Authority of <i>Johannes Tzetzes</i> (a Citizen of
<i>Constantinople</i>, and a very industrious Grammarian) in his <i>Var.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Hist.</i> written above four hundred Years ago. This Author tells us,
that <i>Brenus</i> a <i>Gaul</i>, and Commander in Chief of the <i>Gauls</i>, whom
the <i>Greeks</i> call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαλάται</span>, <i>pass’d over the Sea</i> from thence
to a Place of <i>Byzantium</i>, and that this Place for this Reason was
call’d <i>Pera</i>, which was after their Arrival call’d <i>Galata</i>. This
Place is seated partly on a Hill, and partly on a Plain at the Foot of
it. This Hill is enclosed on the East and West by two Valleys, each
of which is about a Mile in length. The Ridge of the Hill shoots from
North to South, and is in no Part of it less than two hundred Paces
broad, and of equal Length with the Valleys that enclose it, and joins
to the Plain upon the Continent. The South Side of this Hill, and the
Plain below it, is bounded by the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, which makes it almost
a <i>Peninsula</i> of a semicircular Figure, in the Form of a drawn Bow,
with this Difference only, that the Western Point of it is larger by
half; and not quite so long as the Eastern. <i>Galata</i>, as ’tis enclos’d
with a Wall, is four Thousand and four Hundred Paces in Compass. It
varies, in many Places, as to its Breadth. In the middle of the Town
’tis six hundred Paces broad. The Bay and the Walls stand at twenty
Paces Distance. The Plain that runs between the Bay and the Hill, is a
hundred and eighty, and the Hill it self four hundred Paces broad. The
Eastern Side of <i>Galata</i>, at the first Entrance of it, is four hundred
Paces in breadth; after which it contracts it self into the Breadth
of two hundred and sixty Paces only. The Western Side of it, which
stands without Old <i>Galata</i>, rises upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span> moderate Ascent, which winds
Southward, and adjoyns to a small Descent, which terminates Westward
near the Walls of Old <i>Galata</i>. The Town therefore of <i>Galata</i> stands
upon a Treble Descent; one of which winds from North to South, another
falls Easterly, and another at West. The Declivity which crosses the
Breadth of it, stretches from North to South; and is so steep, that in
many Places you are forced to climb it by Steps; so that you ascend
the first Floor of the Houses, which stands upon a Level, by Ladders.
The Eastern and Western Side of <i>Galata</i> have a double Declivity; one
from North to South, the other to East and West; so that not only those
Parts of it which lie in a strait Line, but those Ways also which are
winding, or lie Cross-ways, have their Descents; but the Eastern Side
of the Town is more upon the Declivity than the Western Side of it. To
be short, <i>Galata</i> is of such a Steepness, that if all the Houses were
of an equal Height, the upper Rooms would have a full View of the Sea,
and of all the Ships sailing up and down in it. And not only <i>Galata</i>,
but almost the whole City of <i>Constantinople</i> would have the same
Privilege, if that Law, which was first made by <i>Zeno</i>, and afterwards
ratify’d by <i>Justinian</i>, was in full Force. This Law expressly forbids
any Man to hinder or obstruct an open and entire View of the Sea, or
indeed a Side Prospect of it, and enjoyns the Inhabitants to build at
least at a hundred Paces Distance from it. The Level Part of the Town,
which runs between the Bottom of the Hill and Bay, is, in no Place of
it, less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span> two hundred Paces broad. Towards the Ends of it ’tis
much broader; and, in some Places, it widens to the Length of five
hundred Paces. The Town is thrice as long as it is broad. It extends
it self in Breadth from North to South, in Length from East to West.
The Western Side of it is broader than the Eastern, and almost of an
equal Breadth with the middle of the City. For in a Length of five
hundred Paces, ’tis no less than five hundred Paces broad. The Eastern
Side of <i>Galata</i> is more narrow, where it is no more than two hundred
and sixty Paces broad. The Shore round the Town is full of Havens.
Between the Walls and the Bay is a Piece of Ground, where are Abundance
of <i>Taverns</i>, <i>Shops</i>, <i>Victualing-houses</i>, besides several <i>Wharfs</i>,
where they unlade their Shipping. It has six Gates, at three of which
there are <i>Stairs</i>, from whence you sail over to <i>Constantinople</i>.
<i>Galata</i> is so situate to the North of <i>Constantinople</i>, that it faces
the first, second, and third Hills, and the first and second Valley of
that City; having in Front the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, and <i>Constantinople</i>,
and behind it some Buildings of the Suburbs. For many of these
Buildings stand partly on the Top of the Hill, and partly on the Sides
of it. The Town, it self does not rise to the Ridge of the Hill. Where
<i>Galata</i> rises highest, there is yet standing a very lofty Tower, where
there is an Ascent of about three hundred Paces, full of Buildings,
and beyond that is the Ridge of the Hill upon a Level, about two
hundred Paces broad, and two thousand Paces long. Thro’ the middle of
it runs a broad Way full of Houses, Gardens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span> Vineyards. This is
the most pleasant Part of the Town; from hence, and from the Sides of
the Hill, you have a full View of the Bay of <i>Ceras</i>, the <i>Bosporus</i>,
the <i>Propontis</i>, the seven Hills of <i>Constantinople</i>, the Countrey of
<i>Bithynia</i>, and the Mountain <i>Olympus</i>, always cover’d with Snow. And
besides these, there are many other additional Buildings, which adorn
the Hills, and Vales adjoining to this Town. It has the same Number of
Hills and Vales as <i>Constantinople</i> it self; so that the Inhabitants,
whenever they please, can make the Town one third larger than it is
at present; and if the Grandeur of the <i>Byzantian Empire</i> continues a
hundred Years longer, <i>Galata</i>, it is not improbable, may seem to rival
<i>Constantinople</i> it self. They who write that <i>Byzas</i>, the Founder of
<i>Byzantium</i>, built the Temple of <i>Amphiaraus</i> in <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, are somewhat
in the wrong, tho’ not grosly mistaken. For <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i>
tells us, that behind <i>Syc&aelig;</i> stood the Temple of <i>Amphiaraus</i>, which
was built by those who transplanted a Colony to <i>Constantinople</i>, under
the Command of <i>Byzas</i>. Both the <i>Grecians</i>, and the <i>Megarians</i>,
honour’d <i>Amphiaraus</i> as a God. But altho’ the Temple of <i>Amphiaraus</i>
did not stand in the Place which <i>Dionysius</i> calls <i>Syc&aelig;</i>; yet the
Word <i>Syc&aelig;</i> signified a larger Tract of Ground, after it was made a
City; so that the Temples of <i>Amphiaraus</i>, of <i>Diana Lucifera</i>, and of
<i>Venus Placida</i>, all stood within the Limits of it, as I have fully
made it appear in my <i>Treatise</i> of the <i>Bosporus</i>. But there are no
Remains of these Buildings at present, nor of those Edifices, which,
the <i>Antient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span> Description of the City</i> tells you, were in the <i>Sycene
Ward</i>. The oldest Man now living cannot so much as tell where those
Temples antiently stood, nor ever read or heard, whether there was
ever such a Place as the <i>Sycene Ward</i>. Thus far only we can guess
from the Rules and Usuage of <i>Architecture</i>, that the <i>Theatre</i>, and
<i>Forum</i> of <i>Honorius</i>, stood at the Bottom of the Hill upon a Plain,
where <i>Theatres</i> are generally built, as I frequently observ’d in
my Travels thro’ <i>Greece</i>. There was standing a <i>Forum</i>, in a Level
Ground, (near to the Haven, where is now built a <i>Caravansera</i>, in
the Ruines of a Church dedicated to St. <i>Michael</i>) when first I came
to <i>Constantinople</i>. This <i>Forum</i> was well supply’d with Water by an
ancient subterraneous <i>Aqueduct</i>. In short, there is nothing to be seen
at present of old <i>Syc&aelig;</i>. Those antient Pillars we see in some Mosques
at <i>Galata</i>, are said to have been imported by the <i>Genoese</i>: Some of
them are of very antient Workmanship, and well finish’d. The <i>Cistern</i>
of St. <i>Benedict</i>, now despoil’d of its Roof, and three hundred
Pillars, which supported it, (now turn’d into a <i>Cistern</i> for watering
the Priest’s Gardens) shews it to be a very antique and expensive Work.</p>

<p>From what has been wrote upon this Subject, the Reader may learn how
renown’d <i>Constantinople</i> has been for its Monuments of Antiquity. It
would take up another Volume, to enlarge upon the Publick Buildings
of the <i>Mahometans</i> at present, and to explain for what Uses they
were intended. I shall just touch upon a few Things, which are the
most remarkable. The City, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span> it now stands, contains more than
three hundred Mosques, the most magnificent of which were built by
their Emperors and <i>Basha’s</i>, and are all cover’d at Top with Lead
and Marble, adorn’d with Marble Columns, the Plunder and Sacrilege of
Christian Churches, as these were before beautify’d with the Spoils
of the Heathen Temples. It has above a hundred publick and private
<i>Bagnio’s</i>, fifty of which are very spatious, and of two Lengths, much
like those I have describ’d, built by their Emperour <i>Mahomet</i>. Their
<i>Caravansera’s</i>, and publick Inns, are much above a Hundred; the most
famous of which, in the Middle of their Court-yard, are furnish’d
with Fountains of Water, brought from the Fields adjoyning to the
City. Their Emperors have peculiarly distinguish’d themselves in this
Respect. Thus does <i>Eusebius</i> enlarge in the Praise of <i>Constantine</i>:
In the middle of their <i>Fora</i>, says he, you may see their Fountains
adorn’d with the Emblems of a good <i>Pastor</i>, well known to those who
understand the Sacred Writings; namely, the History of <i>Daniel</i> and the
<i>Lyons</i> figur’d in Brass, and shining with Plates of Gold. <i>Valens</i>,
and <i>Andronicus</i>, at a vast Expence made Rivers, at a remote Distance,
tributary to the Town; partly by directing their Courses under Arches,
at this Time appearing above Ground, and partly by Channels dug
under it. Several other Emperors, with no less Cost, made themselves
Fish-ponds, and subterraneous Lakes, by after Ages call’d <i>Cisterns</i>,
in every Ward of the City, and that principally to supply them with
Water in Case of a Siege. But the Enemies of <i>Constantinople</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span> lie at
present at such a Distance from them, that they have either entirely
ruin’d their <i>Cisterns</i>, or converted them to another Use. I shall take
no Notice of the stately Houses of their Noblemen and <i>Basha’s</i>, nor
of the Grand <i>Signor</i>’s Palace, which spreading it self all over old
<i>Byzantium</i>, is constantly supply’d with Rivers, which flow in upon
it, from distant Parts of the Neighbouring Countrey. I pass by their
Lakes and Conduits, seated in every Part of the City, which serve them
not only with Water to drink, but likewise carry off the Filth of it
into the Sea, and wash away those Impurities of the Town, which clog
and encumber the Air, and for which great Cities are generally look’d
upon as unwholsome. I shall not mention at present, that almost all
the Buildings of <i>Constantinople</i> are low, and made out of the Ruines,
which the Fire and Earthquakes had spar’d; that many of them are not
two Story high, rebuilt with rough Stones, or with burnt, and sometimes
unburnt Bricks. I omit also the Houses of <i>Galata</i>, built by the
<i>Genoese</i>. The <i>Greeks</i> who profess Christianity, have lost their six
hundred Churches, and have not one left, of any Note, except the Church
belonging to the Monastery, where their <i>Patriarch</i> dwells. The rest
are either entirely ruin’d, or prostituted to the <i>Mahometan</i> Worship.
The <i>Francks</i> have about Ten, the <i>Armenians</i> only Seven. The <i>Jews</i>
have upwards of Thirty Synagogues, which are scarce sufficient to hold
the numerous Congregations of that populous Nation. The Reader will
view in a better Light the antient <i>Monuments</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
when he shall peruse the <i>Antient Description of the Wards of the
City</i>, finished before the Time of <i>Justinian</i>, and annex’d at the End
of this Book. When this <i>Treatise</i> was first wrote, <i>Constantinople</i>
was so fully peopled, that those who inhabited the <i>Fora</i>, and the
broad Ways were very straitly pent up; nay, their Buildings were so
closely joyn’d to one another, that the Sky, at the Tops of them,
was scarce discernible. And as to the Buildings in the Suburbs, they
were very thickly crowded together, as far as <i>Selymbria</i>, and the
<i>Black Sea</i>; and indeed some Part even of the neighbouring Sea, was
cover’d with Houses supported by Props under them. For these, and
many other <i>Monuments</i>, was <i>Constantinople</i> antiently renown’d; none
of which are remaining at present, except the <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar of
<i>Constantine</i>, the Pillar of <i>Arcadius</i>, the Church of St. <i>Sophia</i>,
the <i>Hippodrom</i> now in Ruines, and a few <i>Cisterns</i>. No Historian has
recorded the <i>Antiquities</i> of Old <i>Byzantium</i>, before it was destroy’d
by <i>Severus</i>; altho’ it is reasonable to believe, there were very
many of them, especially if it be consider’d, that it long flourish’d
in those Times of <i>Heroism</i>, when Art and Ingenuity were in high
Estimation, and when <i>Rhodes</i>, no ways preferable to <i>Byzantium</i>, was
beautify’d with no less than three thousand <i>Monuments</i>. ’Tis easy
to form a Judgment, from the Strength and Proportion of its outside
Walls, what beauteous Scenes of Cost, and Workmanship were contain’d
within. This we know however for a Certainty, that <i>Darius</i>, <i>Philip</i>
of <i>Macedon</i>, and <i>Severus</i>, demolish’d many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span> of their <i>Antiquities</i>,
and when they had ravag’d the whole City, that the <i>Byzantians</i> made
a noble Stand against the Forces of <i>Severus</i>, with Statues, and
other Materials, which were Part of the Ruines of the City. I have
already in Part accounted for the Ruines of these <i>Curiosities</i>; I
shall at present briefly mention some other Causes which contributed
thereto; the Principal of which was the Division of their Emperors
amongst themselves; frequent Fires, sometimes accidentally, sometimes
designedly occasion’d, not only by their Enemies from abroad, but by
their own Factions, and civil Dissensions among themselves; some of
which burnt with a constant Flame three or four Days together. These
Fires were so raging and terrible, that they did not only consume what
was purely combustible, but they wasted the Marble Statues and Images,
and Buildings made of the most tough and solid Materials whatsoever;
nay, so fierce were they, that they devour’d their own Ruines, and
laid the most mountainous Heaps of Rubbish even with the Ground. Nor
were the antient <i>Monuments</i> of Old <i>Byzantium</i> demolish’d only by
their Enemies, but even by those Emperors who had the greatest Regard
and Affection for the City; the Chief of whom was <i>Constantine</i> the
<i>Great</i>, who, as <i>Eusebius</i> reports, spoil’d the Temples of the Heathen
Gods, laid waste their fine Porches, entirely unroofed them, and took
away their Statues of Brass, of Gold and Silver, in which they glory’d
for many Ages. And to add to the Infamy, that he expos’d them by way
of Mockery and Ridicule, in all the most publick Places of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span> City.
To disgrace them the more, he tells us, that he fill’d it with his
own Statues of Brass, exquisitely finish’d; and then concludes, that
he was so far incensed against the <i>Heathen Monuments</i>, that he made
a Law for the utter Abolishment of them, and the entire Destruction
of their Temples. How far <i>Eusebius</i> himself, and other <i>Christian</i>
Authors were provoked against them, is plainly discernible in their
Writings; namely, that they inveigh’d with the same Severity against
the Images of their Gods, as they do at present against our Statues.
The Emperors <i>Basilius</i> and <i>Gregorius</i>, were bitterly enrag’d not only
against the Images themselves, but against those who wrote too freely
in Justification of them. I shall not mention many other Emperors,
Successors of <i>Constantine</i>, who were so much exasperated even with
the Images of the <i>Christians</i>, that they not only destroy’d them, but
proceeded with such Rigour against those who devis’d, or painted, or
engrav’d them, that they were entitled the <i>Iconomachi</i>, or Champions
that fought against them. I shall say nothing of the Earthquakes,
mention’d in History, which happen’d in the Reigns of <i>Zeno</i>,
<i>Justinian</i>, <i>Leo Conon</i>, <i>Alexius Comnenus</i>, whereby not only the most
considerable Buildings of <i>Constantinople</i>, but almost the whole City
with its Walls were demolish’d, so that they could scarce discover
its antient Foundation, had it not been for the <i>Bosporus</i>, and
<i>Propontis</i>, the eternal Boundaries of <i>Constantinople</i>, which enclose
it. I pass by the large <i>Wards</i> of the City, which through the Poverty
of the Inhabitants, after frequent Fires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span> and the Ravage of War, lay
a long Time in Ruins, but were at last rebuilt; tho’ the Streets are
promiscuously huddled up without Regularity, or Order. These were the
Causes, as <i>Livy</i> relates of Old <i>Rome</i>, after it was burnt down, that
not only the antient common Shores, but the <i>Aqu&aelig;ducts</i> and <i>Cisterns</i>,
formerly running in the open Streets, now have their Courses under
private Houses, and the City looks rather like one solid Lump of
Building, than divided into Streets and Lanes. I shall not mention how
the large Palaces of their Emperors, seated in the middle of the City,
nor the Seats of the Nobility enclosing great Tracts of Land, nor how
the old Foundations still appearing above Ground, nor the Remains of
Buildings, discover’d by the nicest Discernment under it, are almost
entirely defac’d. Had I not seen, the Time I liv’d at <i>Constantinople</i>,
so many ruinated Churches and Palaces, and their Foundations, since
fill’d with <i>Mahometan</i> Buildings, so that I could hardly discover
their former Situation, I had not so easily conjectured, what
Destruction the <i>Turks</i> had made, since they took the City. And tho’
they are always contriving to beautify it with publick Buildings, yet
at present it looks more obscurely in the Day, than it did formerly in
the Night; when, as <i>Marcellinus</i> tells us, the Brightness of their
Lights, resembling a Meridian Sun-shine, reflected a Lustre from their
Houses. The Clearness of the Day now only serves to shew the Meanness
and Poverty of their Buildings; so that was <i>Constantine</i> himself
alive, who rebuilt and beautify’d it, or others who enlarg’d it, they
could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span> not discover the Situation of their antient Structures. The
Difficulties I labour’d under in the Search of Antiquity here were very
great. I was a Stranger in the Countrey, had very little Assistance
from any Inscriptions, none from Coins, none from the People of the
Place. They, as having a natural Aversion to any thing that’s valuable
in Antiquity, did rather prevent me in my Enquiries, so that I scarce
dar’d to take the Dimensions of any Thing, being menac’d, and curs’d
if I did, by the <i>Greeks</i> themselves. A Foreigner has no way to allay
the Heat and Fury of these People, but by a large Dose of Wine. If
you don’t often invite them, and tell them <i>you’ll be as drunk</i> as
a <i>Greek</i>, they’ll use you in a very coarse manner. Their whole
Conversation is frothy and insipid, as retaining no Custom of the old
<i>Byzantians</i>, but a Habit of fuddling. It is not the least, among these
Inconveniencies, that I could not have Recourse to so many Authors in
describing <i>Constantinople</i>, as a Writer may have in describing Old
<i>Rome</i>. They are so fond of Change and Novelty, that any Thing may be
called <i>Antique</i> among them, which is beyond the Memory of them, or
was transacted in the first Stages of Humane Life. And not only the
magnificent Structures of antient Times have been demolish’d by them,
but the very Names of them are quite lost, and a more than <i>Scythian</i>
Barbarity prevails among them. The <i>Turks</i> are so tenacious of their
own Language, that they give a new Name to all Places, which are
forc’d to submit to their Power, tho’ it be never so impertinent and
improper. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span> such an Abhorrence of <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i>, that
they look upon both these Tongues to be Sorcery and Witchcraft. All the
Assistance I had was my own Observation, the Memory, and Recollection
of others, and some Insight into antient History. By these Assistances
principally I discovered the Situation of the fourteen <i>Wards</i> of the
City. The Inhabitants are daily demolishing, effacing, and utterly
destroying the small Remains of Antiquity; so that whosoever shall
engage himself in the same Enquiries after me, though they may far
exceed me in Industry and Application, yet they will not be able to
make any farther Discoveries of the <i>Monuments</i> of the fourteen Wards.
But it is not my Intention to prefer my self above other Writers; if I
can any way be assistant to future Times, my End is answered. I hope I
need make no Apology for recording in History such <i>Monuments</i> as are
falling into Ruines; and if my Stay at <i>Constantinople</i> was somewhat
longer than I intended, I hope it will not be any Imputation upon me,
as it was occasioned by the Death of my Royal Master. It was by his
Command that I travelled into <i>Greece</i>, not with any Design of staying
long at <i>Constantinople</i>, but to make a Collection of the antient
<i>Greek</i> MSS. Not with any Intention of describing only that City; but
as a farther Improvement of Human Knowledge, that I might delineate
the Situation of several other Places and Cities. Upon the Death of my
King, (not having Remittances sufficient) I was forc’d, with a small
Competency, to travel thro’ <i>Asia</i>, and <i>Greece</i>, to this Purpose; and
I can assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span> the Reader, that I did not undertake this Voyage upon
any Prospect of sensual Pleasure, any View of worldly Interest, or any
Affectation of popular Applause; no, I could have liv’d in Ease, more
to my own Advantage; and in a much better State of Health, as to all
Appearance, in my own Countrey. Not all the Dangers and Inconveniencies
of a long and a laborious Voyage could ever move me to a speedy Return.
How I came to engage my self in such unfortunate Travels I know not.
I was very apprehensive of the Troubles and Dangers, which I must
necessarily undergo, and which indeed have befallen me, before I
ventur’d upon such an Undertaking; yet I would willingly persuade my
self, that my Resolutions herein were Good, and my Design Honourable;
being confirm’d in the Opinion of the <i>Platonists</i>, That <i>we ought to
be indefatigable in the Search of Truth</i>; and, <i>That ’tis beneath a Man
to give over, when his Enquiries are Useful, and Becoming</i>.</p>

that the following Passage is not to be met with in any of the Printed
Copies of</i> Choniat, <i>but is a Transcript from him in that Part of his
Book, where he writes, concerning the Statues of</i> Constantinople,

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Roman</i> Conquerours, who were of an with avaritious Temper, even
to a Proverb, practis’d a new Method of Rapine and Plunder, entirely
unknown to those who had taken the City before them. For breaking open
by Night the Royal Sepulchres in the great Grove of the <i>Heroum</i>, they
sacrilegiously rifled the Corps of those Blessed Disciples of <i>Jesus
Christ</i>, and carry’d off whatsoever was valuable in Gold, Rings, and
Jewels, which they could find in these Repositories of the Dead. But
coming to the Body of the Emperor <i>Justinian</i>, and finding his Coffin
untouch’d, tho’ it was publickly known for some Years that it was
nobly enrich’d, aw’d with in Fear and Admiration, they forbore to
disturb the Imperial Ashes. And as they express’d no Reverence and
Regard to the Dead, so were they equally Savage and Inhuman in their
Treatment of the Living; even to those who were their own Countreymen.
They spar’d neither the House of <span class="smcap">God</span>, nor his Ministers, but
stripped the great Church (<i>Sancta Sophia</i>) of all its fine Ornaments
and Hangings, made of the richest Brocades, of inestimable Value: But
still continuing unsatiable in their Avarice, they no sooner cast their
Eyes upon the brazen Statues, than they order’d them to be melted down.
The fine <i>Statue of Juno in Brass</i>, which stood in the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Constantine</i>, they chopt in Pieces, and threw it into the Forge. The
Head of this Statue was so large, that four Yoke of Oxen could scarce
drag it into the Palace. Upon the <i>Base</i> of it was cut, in <i>Basso
Relievo</i>, the Figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span> <i>Paris</i>, <i>Venus</i> standing by him, presenting
her with the Apple of Discord. The noble <i>Quadrilateral Pillar</i>,
supported with several Ranges of Pillars, and which by its Height
overlook’d the whole City, and was both the Wonder and the Delight of
the curious Spectator, shared the same Fate. This lofty Column was
adorn’d with rural Representations of all kinds of singing Birds, Folds
of Cattle, milking Pails, of Sheep bleating, and of Lambs frisking and
playing, <i>&amp;c.</i> There was also engrav’d upon it a View of the Sea and
Sea-Gods; some of whom were catching Fish with their Hands; others
ordering their Nets, then diving to the Bottom; whilst some in a wanton
Manner, were throwing Balls at one another. This Pillar supported a
<i>Pyramid</i> at the Top of it, upon which was plac’d the <i>Statue of a
Woman</i>, which turn’d about with the Wind, and was therefore called
<i>Anemodes</i>. This excellent Piece was also melted down for Coinage, as
was also an <i>Equestrian</i> Statue, fixed upon a Quadrilateral <i>Pedestal</i>
in the <i>Taurus</i>. This was a bold Figure, of an heroic Countenance,
and surprizing Stature. It was reported by some, that he was one
of the Spies, who was sent by <i>Joshua</i> the Son of <i>Nun</i>. With one
Hand he pointed Eastward, with the other to the West, and the Coast
of <i>Gabeon</i>. But this Statue was generally believed to represent
<i>Bellerophon</i>, (born and brought up at <i>Peloponnesus</i>) sitting upon
<i>Pegasus</i>; for the Horse was without a Bridle, as <i>Pegasus</i> is mostly
figur’d, scouring the Plain, despising a Rider, flying and driving
about in a headstrong manner. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span> is an old Report, which at this
Day is in every Body’s Mouth, that there was stampt in the Breast-Plate
of this Horse, with great Skill, the Figure of a Man, which appear’d
outwardly; this Image was either one of the <i>Venetici</i>, the
<i>Epizophurii</i>, or the <i>Bulgari</i>, who were not, at that Time, conquer’d
by the <i>Romans</i>. This Horse and his Rider were also melted down. In the
Accoutrements of this Horse was likewise found a small brazen Image,
wrapp’d up as it were in Wool, which the <i>Romans</i> look’d upon to be
of little or no Value, and therefore threw that also into the Fire.
Neither did the Resentment of the barbarous and unpolite Soldiers stop
here, but they expressed the utmost Fury against the finest Statues,
and most curious Pieces of Workmanship in the <i>Hippocum</i>, cutting
the largest of them, which cost immense Sums, into small Coins of
little Value. The great Statue of <i>Hesperian Hercules</i>, fix’d upon a
magnificent <i>Pedestal</i>, clothed in a Lyon’s Skin, which seem’d to live,
and affright the Spectators with his tremendous Voice, felt the Marks
of military Power. He was not here arm’d with his Quiver, his Bow, or
his Club, but stretching out his right Leg and Arm, he kneeled upon
his left Knee, and leaning upon his left Elbow, with his Hand open, he
supported his Head in a thoughtful Manner, and seem’d to lament his
Misfortunes; uneasy above all at those which <i>Eurystheus</i> out of mere
Envy had impos’d upon him. This Figure was broad-chested, the Shoulders
were large, his Hair long, curl’d, and reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span> to his Waste; his Arms
were brawny, and as long as those of the Original made by <i>Lysimachus</i>,
which was the first and last Master-piece of his Skill. In short, of
such a stupendous Size was this Statue, that his Wrist was as thick as
a Man’s Body, and the Length of his Leg equal in height to that of any
ordinary Person. This noble Statue, I say, did not escape the Rage of
these mighty Pretenders to native Virtue and Honour: Beside this, they
also carry’d away the <i>Image of the Loaded Ass</i> and his <i>Driver</i>. These
Figures were set up originally by <i>Augustus C&aelig;sar</i> at <i>Actium</i>, of
whom the Fable goes, that when he went out privately in the Night Time
to take a View of <i>Anthony</i>’s Army, he met a Man driving an Ass; and
asking him “<i>Who he was</i>, and <i>whither he was going</i>? He answered, <i>my
Name is</i> Nichon, <i>and my Ass’s</i> Nichander, <i>and I am going to C&aelig;sar’s
Army</i>”. The <i>Statues</i> also of the <i>Hy&aelig;na</i>, and the <i>Wolf</i> which suckled
<i>Romulus</i> and <i>Remus</i>, underwent the same Fate, and were coyn’d into
little brazen <i>Staters</i>. The <i>several Statues</i> also of a <i>Man</i> fighting
with a <i>Lyon</i>, of the Horse <i>Neil&ocirc;us</i>, cover’d with Scales behind, of
an <i>Elephant</i> with a moving <i>Proboscis</i>, of the <i>Sphinx’s</i>, beautiful
as Women, and terrible as Beasts; which can occasionally walk, or fly
in the Air, to fight with Birds of Prey. There was also the <i>Statue</i>
of a <i>wild Horse</i>, pricking up his Ears, snorting, curvetting, and
prancing; this, and <i>old Scylla</i> were served in the same injurious
Manner. She was figur’d like a Woman to the Waste, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span> a grim
frightful Look, just as she appear’d, when she sent her Dogs to destroy
<i>Ulysses</i>. There was also plac’d in the <i>Hippocum</i> a <i>brazen Eagle</i>,
which was the Invention of <i>Apollonius Tyan&aelig;us</i>, and a celebrated
<i>Monument</i> of his Sorcery. This Impostor, when he was once requested
by the <i>Byzantians</i>, to heal them of the Bitings of Serpents, which
was then a common Malady among them, immediately using some diabolical
Charms, and heathenish Ceremonies, he plac’d this Eagle upon a Pillar;
it was a pleasant Sight enough, and deserv’d the Curiosity of being
more narrowly inspected; for it made an agreeable Harmony, and less
dangerous than that of the <i>Syrens</i>. Its Wings were stretch’d out, as
ready for Flight, and it was trampling upon a <i>Serpent</i>, wreathing it
self about him. The Serpent seem’d to make the utmost Effort to bite
the Eagle, but its Venom had no Power to hurt him. The Eagle seem’d
to gripe him so hard in his Talons, that he was forced to hang down
his Head quietly, and seem’d either to be unwilling, or unable to spit
his Venom at him. The <i>Eagle</i>, on the other Hand, look’d brisk and
sprightly, and having obtain’d the Victory, seem’d to be in Haste, to
bear him through the Air in Triumph, denoting by the Sprightliness
of his Look, and the Feebleness of the Serpent, that the Serpents,
that tormented the <i>Byzantians</i>, would hurt them no more, but suffer
themselves even to be handled and strok’d by them. But these were not
the only Curiosities observable in this <i>Aquiline</i> Statue. It was also
very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span> remarkable, that the <i>twelve Hours</i> were engraven under its
Wings, under each Wing six, which shew’d the Hour of the Day, by the
Rays of the Sun darting thro’ a Hole in each Wing, artificially made
for that Purpose. But what shall I now say of the fine Proportions
of <i>Helen</i>, who engag’d all <i>Greece</i> in her Quarrel, and for whose
Sake <i>Troy</i> itself was laid in Ruines? No Wonder that when living
she could charm the most stubborn, and soften the most impenetrable
Heart, when in breathing Brass she captivated all that saw her. Her
Habit sat loose upon her, which discover’d too great an Inclination
for Gallantry. Her Hair, which seem’d to wave in the Wind, was long
and delicate, braided with Gold and Jewels. Her Robe was girt about
her, falling down to the Knee. Her Lips seem’d like the opening Roses,
you would fancy they mov’d, and such an agreeable Smile brightned her
Countenance, as entertain’d the Eye of the Spectator with Pleasure. It
is impossible for me to describe the Sweetness and Chearfulness of her
Looks, the Arches of her Eyes, and the perfect Symmetry of the whole
Statue. Take it therefore as it is given us by Poets and Historians.
<i>Helen</i> the Daughter of <i>Tyndarus</i> was the Perfection of Beauty, the
Child of Love, the Pride, and the Care of <i>Venus</i>; the Master-piece of
Nature, the great Prize of the <i>Grecians</i> and <i>Trojans</i>. Where is now
your <i>Nepenthe</i>, the secret Charm to guard you from all Evils? Where
are your irresistible <i>Philtrums</i>? Why did you not use them against
these barbarous Invaders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span> with the same Success as you did formerly?
But I suppose it was determined by the Fates, that you should fall
by the Force of Fire, who have rais’d such Flames in the Breasts of
those who came to behold you; or perhaps these our new Conquerours,
who pretend to be descended from the <i>Trojans</i>, threw your Statue into
the Fire, to revenge the burning of that City, of which you was only
the innocent Cause. But I can neither think nor speak with Patience of
these avaritious Monsters, who have demolish’d the most valuable, the
most curious, the most costly Statues in the whole World; Fellows, who
would have sold their Wives for Money; who behav’d themselves rather
like Birds of Prey, than a regular well-disciplin’d Army; only with
this Difference, that they spent their Prey as loosely, as they got
it ingloriously, and would willingly venture their Lives to support
their Extravagance. Hear these Verses of <i>Homer</i>, who is well known
to the <i>Greeks</i> and the <i>Barbarians</i>; to the Learned, and Unlearned,
concerning <i>Helen</i>.</p>

<p>Pardon this Digression:—There was also plac’d upon a Pillar a more
<i>modern Statue</i> of a <i>Woman</i>, which was very curious and agreeable. Her
Hair hung down behind, combed close down from the Forehead backwards,
not breaded up, but bending to the Hand of the Spectator. Upon the
right Hand of this Statue stood the <i>Equestrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span> Statue</i> of a <i>Man</i>.
The Horse stood upon one Leg, the other bore a Cup with a mix’d Potion.
The Rider was of a large Size, his Body compleatly arm’d, his Legs
and his Feet were cover’d with Greaves, his Air was manly, rough, and
warlike. The Horse was mettlesome, and high courag’d, pricking up
his Ears, as tho’ he heard the Trumpet. His Neck was high, his Look
fierce, his Eyes sparkling, as eager for the Battle; he rear’d up
his Fore-feet, and pranced like a War-Horse. Near this Statue, hard
by the Eastern Goal, call’d <i>Rusius</i>, were a Range of <i>Statues</i> of
<i>Charioteers</i>, dextrous in driving the Chariot, and turning the Goal.
They were very busy in managing their Bridles, and smacking their
Whips, and directing their Horses, with their Eyes fix’d steddily upon
the Goal. In short, there seem’d to be describ’d in these <i>Figures</i>
all the Tumult and Fury of a Chariot Race, with the most vigorous
Struggle for Victory and Success. This Description of these Statues
may seem imperfect; for it never was my Intention to describe them
all. But what gave me the most agreeable Pleasure, and seem’d to me
the most admirable Piece of Workmanship, was a large <i>Pedestal</i>, upon
which was plac’d <i>an Animal cast in Brass</i>, as large as an Ox, having
a short Tail, and a moderate Dewlap, something like the <i>&AElig;gyptian</i>
Cattle. It had no Hoofs; but held in its Teeth, ready to strangle it,
another <i>Animal</i>, cloth’d all over with Scales, almost impenetrable. It
seem’d to be a <i>Basilisk</i>, and had a Mouth somewhat like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span> Serpent’s.
It was taken by many to be an Ox of the <i>Nile</i>, and by some to be a
<i>Crocodile</i>. But I forbear to give the several Conjectures upon it.
These Figures however seem’d to represent an odd Sort of Fight, each
of them furiously striving for Victory. The Creature which seem’d to
be the <i>Basilisk</i> was in Colour like a Frog, and was all over bloated
from Head to Foot. He was casting out his Venom upon his Antagonist,
with an Intent to destroy him. This <i>Animal</i> was carv’d as bearing upon
one Knee, and in a languishing Condition. This Observation gave the
Spectators occasion to believe it fallen dead backward, if the <i>Base</i>
where he stood had not supported him. There was also the <i>Figure</i> of
another <i>Animal</i>, in whose Jaws was represented a Smaller Creature,
whose Mouth was open as almost choak’d by the Teeth which held him,
struggling to get loose, but to no Purpose. His Tail, which was very
Short, seem’d to tremble; his Shoulders, his fore Feet, and the hinder
Part of his Body, were hid in the Mouth of his Enemy, and mash’d by
his Jaws. These <i>Animals</i> also mutually kill’d each other. Thus we
may observe, that these Poisonous Creatures, so destructive to Man,
are no less noxious to each other. And this, many Times, is the Case
of Nations, and Kingdoms, as was exemplify’d in the <i>Romans</i>, when
they made War upon us; killing, and destroying one another, through
the Power of <i>Christ</i>, who rejoyceth not in Blood, and disperseth the
Nations that delight in War; who maketh the Just to walk upon the
Adder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span> and the Basilisk, and treadeth the Lyon and Dragon under his
Feet.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The first Ward.</i>] ’Tis evident from <i>Pliny</i>, and also from <i>Tacitus</i>,
in that Part of his History, where he mentions the Burning of the City
by <i>Nero</i>, that antient <i>Rome</i> was divided into fourteen <i>Regions</i>, or
<i>Wards</i>. <i>Sex. Rufus</i>, and <i>P. Victor</i>, who had pass’d the <i>Consular</i>
Dignity, have given us some short Descriptions of them. As to the
<i>Wards</i> of <i>New Rome</i>, they are here described as I found them placed
before the <i>Notitia Utriusque Imperii</i>. <i>Constantinople</i>, which
was a kind of Representation of <i>Old Rome</i>, was likewise after her
Example, as <i>Justinian</i> observes in his 43ᵈ <i>Novel</i>, divided into
fourteen <i>Wards</i>; and he calls them <i>Regions</i> or <i>Wards</i>. There were
many Monuments of Antiquity carried thither from <i>Old Rome</i>, and
many new ones made there, which I could by no Means pass by, as the
Accounts of them may be necessary to the Knowledge of both Places. And
therefore to explain and illustrate them the more, I have subjoined
some <i>Annotations</i> of my own; and have also taken Notice, as they
fell in my Way, of some Observations made in my <i>Comments</i> on the
<i>Notitia</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> The Author of the <i>Description</i> observes this Method.
The Churches, and other Matters which are most Material, he treats of
in the first Place, then he mentions what is less Important, in the
same Order, in every <i>Ward</i>; as the Streets, Houses, <i>Bagnio’s</i>, Mills,
the <i>Gradus</i>, then the <i>Curator</i>, <i>Vernaculus</i>, the <i>Collegiati</i>, and
last of all, the <i>Vico-Magistri</i>. In the thirteenth <i>Ward</i>, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_A6" id="Page_A6">6</a></span>
a Mistake, the Streets are omitted, which Error I have taken Care to
correct, as I have also another in the fourteenth <i>Ward</i>, where he has
left out the <i>Curator</i>, the <i>Vernaculus</i>, the <i>Collegiati</i>, and the
<i>Vico-Magistri</i>. He mentions only fourteen Churches, in seven <i>Wards</i>;
whereas at <i>Rome</i>, there was not a Street without some Temple or other,
and some had two. I shall make my <i>Annotations</i> upon every Monument of
Antiquity, in the same <i>Ward</i>, and in the same Place, that I find it.</p>

<p><i>The House of</i> Placidia Augusta.] This Lady was the Daughter of
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>, and Sister of <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Honorius</i>. When
<i>New Rome</i> was taken by <i>Alaric</i>, King of the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i>,
he carried her away into Captivity, who afterward married his Kinsman
and Successor <i>Athaulfus</i>. Upon his Death, she was restored to her
Countrey, and being married again to <i>Constantius</i>, she had by him
two Sons, <i>Valentinian</i> and <i>Honoriades</i>; as <i>Eutropius</i>, <i>Zonaras</i>,
<i>Cedrinus</i>, and other Historians tell us.</p>

<p><i>The House of the most illustrious</i> Marina.] <i>Marina</i> was the Daughter
of <i>Arcadius</i>, who being honoured with the Title of the <i>Most
Illustrious</i>, as <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, continued a Virgin. The Title of
the <i>Most Illustrious</i>, is discovered by an antient Inscription to
have been first given to <i>Valerianus</i> the Younger, about the Year of
our Lord 260. Afterwards it was given to <i>Severinus</i>, and <i>Maximinus
C&aelig;sar</i>, and at Length it was ascribed to Ladies of the highest
Birth. This sometimes entitled them to a Share in the Government;
for whosoever was dignified with this Character, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A7" id="Page_Page_A7">7</a></span> allowed to
wear a Purple Habit, laced round with Gold, and took Place of the
<i>Pr&aelig;fecti</i>, (the Mayors or Chief Magistrates of the City) as <i>Zosimus</i>
observes, who will have it, that this Honour was first instituted by
<i>Constantine</i>; tho’ ’tis very evident, that this Dignity was conferred
long before his Time.</p>

<p><i>The Bagnio’s of</i> Arcadius.] They were so called, because they were
built by him, as <i>Procopius</i> writes in his 1st <i>Orat.</i> concerning the
Buildings of <i>Justinian</i>. As you sail, says he, out of the <i>Propontis</i>,
to the Eastern Coast, you see a Publick <i>Bagnio</i>, call’d the <i>Arcadian
Bagnio</i>, which is a great Ornament to the City. In this Place
<i>Justinian</i> built a Court, which lies before the City, so near to the
Sea, that they who walk upon the Shore, may hold a Discourse with any
of the Ships Crew, as they sail by them. The Account I shall give of
the Curiosities of this Court, is as follows. The Court it self is a
very beautiful Building, and is fann’d with gentle Breezes. ’Tis paved
with delicate Marble, and adorned with stately Pillars, which afford
a delectable Prospect, even to a Brightness, which seems to rival a
Meridian Sun-shine. There are also many other Curiosities which adorn
this Court, some of which are Pieces of most elegant Workmanship, both
in Brass and Stone. Thus far <i>Procopius</i>. The <i>Bagnio’s</i> here mentioned
are probably the same with those which are called the <i>Xerolophus</i>,
which <i>Cedrinus</i> tells us were built by <i>Arcadius</i>. The <i>Xerolophus</i>,
says he, was built by <i>Arcadius</i>, the Pillars of which are all like
that Pillar, which <i>Theodosius</i> erected in the <i>Taurus</i>. <i>Socrates</i> in
his <i>Seventh</i> Book, <i>Chap.</i> 1. attests, that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A8" id="Page_Page_A8">8</a></span> Building stood in
the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Arcadius</i>. For speaking of one <i>Sabbatius</i> a Heretick,
he says, that the People rais’d a Tax to oppose <i>Sesonnicus</i> their
Bishop, in a Place of the City which is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ξηρόλοφος</span>,
in the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Arcadius</i>. Thus <i>Socrates</i>. This was certainly
a Building which consisted of several Apartments, which induces me
to believe it was the <i>Bagnio’s</i> here mentioned. For <i>Nicephorus
Gregoras</i>, in his <i>Seventh Book</i>, <i>Chap.</i> 1. writes, That <i>Athanasius</i>,
Patriarch of <i>Constantinople</i>, resided some Time in the Apartments
of the <i>Xerolophus</i>. The Word <i>Xerolophus</i>, says <i>Suidas</i>, signifies
a <i>Dry Unction</i>, and the Place was called so, because, when any Body
was anointed there, they never used to bath, and adds; That this
Place was formerly famous for Oracles, and that answers were given to
Enquiries there made, from a <i>Tripos</i>. There were also in the same
Place sixteen private Apartments, with Winding-Stairs. I have seen it
in an antient <i>Greek</i> Author, that there were here twelve Buildings
with Winding-Stairs, as also the Columns of <i>Diana</i>, <i>Severus</i>,
<i>Marcianus</i>, and the Statues of <i>Valentinian</i>, and <i>Theodosius</i> the
<i>Less</i>. <i>Justinian</i> also quotes an Inscription there, taken out of
the <i>Fifth Book</i> of <i>Xenophon</i>’s <i>Anabasis</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> also writes,
that when <i>Leo Isaurus</i> was Emperor of <i>Constantinople</i>, the Statue of
<i>Arcadius</i>, placed upon a Pillar in the <i>Xerolophus</i>, was thrown down
by an Earthquake. The <i>Bagnio’s</i> here mentioned were called Publick, or
Imperial <i>Bagnio’s</i>; whereas those which were built by private Persons
were called <i>Therm&aelig;</i>, or <i>Baths</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A9" id="Page_Page_A9">9</a></span></p>

<p><i>A Hundred and eighteen Houses.</i>] I take the Word <i>Houses</i> in this
Place, to signifie the Dwelling Houses of some of the principal Men
of the City, as the Great Mens Houses at <i>Rome</i> were distinguished by
standing by themselves, and having no other Houses adjoining to them.</p>

<p><i>Two</i> Portico’s <i>of a great Length</i>.] These <i>Portico’s</i>, as at present,
were not joined to Houses, so as to seem a Part of them, but were
built separate from them, contrived for the Pleasure of Walking, and
refreshing the Mind. Hence it is, that <i>Strabo</i>, <i>Lib.</i> V. <i>de Geogra.</i>
where he is describing the Parts of <i>Rome</i>, calls the <i>Portico</i> of
<i>Livia</i> the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπατον</span>, or Walk. <i>Pliny</i> is of the same Opinion
in his <i>Fourth Book</i>, <i>Chap.</i> 1. <i>Strabo</i> tells us in another Place,
that the <i>Cumani</i> of <i>&AElig;olis</i> borrowed Money to build a <i>Portico</i>, and
that when they failed, as to the Time of Payment, the Person, who gave
them Credit, laid them under a Prohibition not to walk in it, but only
when it rained; and when the Cryer called aloud to them to enter the
<i>Portico</i>, it passed into a Proverb, <i>That the Cumani</i> dared not to
enter their <i>Portico</i> without the Leave of the Cryer. These are the
same Kind of <i>Portico’s</i> which <i>Ulpian</i> means, where he mentions the
<i>Portico’s</i>, which had no Houses adjoining to them. <i>Tacitus</i>, <i>Lib.</i>
XV. speaking of the Burning of <i>Rome</i> by <i>Nero</i>, takes Notice of these
Ambulatory <i>Portico’s</i>, when he tells us, that the <i>Portico’s</i> which
were dedicated to Pleasure, were most of them destroyed by Fire. There
was a <i>Portico</i> of this Sort at <i>Athens</i>, Part of which, as <i>Pliny</i>
records, <i>Lib.</i> XXXV. <i>Cap.</i> 3. was painted by <i>Myco</i>, who was paid
for it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A10" id="Page_Page_A10">10</a></span> the other Part was finished <i>gratis</i> by <i>Polygnotus</i>, an
eminent Painter. It was for this Reason, that ’twas call’d <i>Porticus
varia</i>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποικίλη</span>. This is the same <i>Portico</i> in which <i>Zeno</i>
taught, and for which he was called the Father of the <i>Stoicks</i>.
<i>Suidas</i> says, that it was customary to adorn such <i>Portico’s</i>
with Silver and Marble Statues, as appears by a Will mentioned by
<i>Marcellus</i>, which runs thus, <i>My Will and Pleasure is, that my Heir,
at his own Expence, build in my native Countrey a Publick</i> Portico,
<i>in which, I desire my Silver and Marble Statues may be reposited</i>.
I believe my Author understands in this Clause of the Will, the same
Kind of <i>Portico’s</i> with those I now comment upon, which were of so
considerable a Length, that they reached from the Imperial Palace, to
the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>. For <i>Procopius</i> writes, in his <i>First
Orat. de &AElig;dif. Justin.</i> That in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, the Church
of St. <i>Sophia</i>, and both the long <i>Portico’s</i>, stretching themselves
as far as the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Constantine</i>, were burnt down. The same Fact
is testified by <i>Cedrinus</i>, who says, that both these <i>Portico’s</i> were
consumed by Fire, in the Reign of <i>Basiliscus</i>, altho’ after these
Casualities, they were always rebuilt. I would observe, that every
<i>Ward</i> at <i>Constantinople</i> had in it some <i>Portico’s</i>, though some
<i>Wards</i> at Rome had none.</p>

<p><i>Four Gradus.</i>] The Word, which is here called <i>Gradus</i>, signifies a
Tribunal, which was ascended by Marble Steps, to receive the Bread
which was to be distributed among the common People, and which, was
therefore called, <i>Panis Gradilis</i>. <i>Valentinian</i> tells us, that the
carrying the <i>Panis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A11" id="Page_Page_A11">11</a></span> Gradilis</i> from one Tribunal to another, is
strictly forbidden. He also commands in <i>Cod. Theod.</i> that every one
receive the <i>Panis Gradilis</i> from the Tribunal. From which Passages
it is plain, that this <i>Gradus</i> was a famous Tribunal, from whence
they used to distribute Bread. For <i>Constantine</i>, as <i>Metaphrastes</i>
writes, bestowed every Day upon the Poor, eighty Thousand Loaves.
<i>Socrates</i>, <i>Lib.</i> II. <i>Cap.</i> 13. says expressly, that he gave Daily
eighty Thousand Bushels of Corn to the Poor; besides, as <i>Suidas</i> adds,
Wine, and Flesh, and Oil. These were therefore <i>Gradus</i>, or Tribunals,
erected in this <i>Ward</i> for that Purpose.</p>

<p><i>It was governed by one</i> Curator, <i>who had under his Charge the whole</i>
Ward.] The <i>Curators</i> (who seem something like our Aldermen) were first
instituted by <i>Augustus</i>, and by <i>Suetonius</i>, <i>Cap.</i> XXX. are called
<i>Magistratus</i>. He divided, says he, meaning <i>Augustus</i>, the City into
Streets and <i>Wards</i>, and commanded that the <i>Wards</i> should be governed
by a Magistrate, chosen by Lot yearly, and that the Streets should be
governed by a Master elected out of the common People. Afterwards, in
the Room of these, <i>Alexander Augustus</i> appointed fourteen <i>Curators</i>.
<i>Lampridius</i> tells us, that <i>Rome</i> chose fourteen <i>Curators</i>, out of
the most eminent Citizens, and obliged them to assist the <i>Prefect</i> of
the City, so that all, or most of them attended, when any Thing was
transacted for the good of the Publick. It was a principal Part of
their Business to decide Causes, and to take Care of Orphans, and the
Poor.</p>

<p><i>There was also one</i> Vernaculus <i>who was Messenger of the</i> Ward, <i>he
assisted the</i> Curator, <i>and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A12" id="Page_Page_A12">12</a></span> entirely at his Command</i>.] The
Business of this Officer was to be subservient to the <i>Curator</i>, and
give Notice to, and summon the Citizens to meet in all Matters, which
more immediately related to the <i>Ward</i>. Their Office was the same,
mentioned by <i>S. Rufus</i>, and <i>P. Victor</i>, who give them at <i>Old Rome</i>,
the Name of <i>Denunciatores</i>. Two of which were appointed to assist in
every <i>Ward</i>.</p>

<p><i>It had also twenty five</i> Collegiati, <i>chosen out of the several Bodies
of Tradesmen, whose Business it was, to direct and assist in Cases of
Fire</i>.] At <i>Rome</i> the <i>Pr&aelig;fectus Vigilum</i> commanded in Chief the seven
Companies of Freemen appointed for a constant Watch to the City. This
Office was instituted by <i>Augustus</i>, who placed a single Company over
two <i>Wards</i>, as is observed by <i>Suetonius</i>, and <i>Dion.</i> <i>Lib.</i> LV.
and by <i>Paullus</i>, <i>Lib. de Offi. pr&aelig;. Vigil.</i> These Men were chosen
out of the several Bodies of the Tradesmen, whose Business was the
same with those at <i>Rome</i>; and were called <i>Collegiati.</i> The Number
of them was always stated, and unalterable so that when one of them
died, the <i>Prefect</i> of the City filled up the Vacancy with one of his
own Body. <i>Honorius</i> and <i>Theodosius</i>, in their <i>Letters Mandatory</i>
to <i>&AElig;stius Prefect</i> of the City, will and command, <i>That the Number
of five hundred sixty three be the standing Number of them, and that
no Person presume by any Authority whatsoever, to alter that Number;
so that it shall be lawful to you only, in the Presence of the Body
Corporate, when any Person is deceased, or otherways removed, to elect,
and nominate one to succeed him out of the same Body Corporate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A13" id="Page_Page_A13">13</a></span> of
which he was a Member</i>: These <i>Collegiati</i> are chosen out of thirty
five Corporations of Tradesmen, which are particularly specified in
a Letter sent by <i>Constantine</i> to <i>Maximus</i>, and are discharged upon
their Election from all other Offices whatsoever. In this first <i>Ward</i>,
there were only twenty five of them, in others more or less, who made
up the Number a Hundred and sixty, or a Hundred and sixty three. To
complete the Number of which, as appears from the first Book of <i>Zeno
de Collegiat.</i> Thirty seven or forty, are wanting in the last <i>Ward</i>.
The Word <i>Collegiati</i>, in other Places, sometimes signifies the
<i>Deacons</i> who buried the Dead; and sometimes it is taken for <i>Freemen</i>,
as in <i>Lib.</i> XLI. <i>Co. Theod. de Op. Pub.</i></p>

<p><i>There were also five</i> Vico-Magistri, <i>whose Business it was to watch
the City by Night</i>.] These were originally instituted by <i>Augustus</i>.
<i>Suetonius</i>, in the Life of <i>Augustus</i>, <i>Chap.</i> XXX. writes, that the
City was divided into Streets and <i>Wards</i>, and adds, that <i>Augustus</i>
commanded, that the Magistrates of the <i>Wards</i> should be annually
chosen by Lot. The Streets were governed by the <i>Vico-Magistri</i>, who
were elected out of the Commons, in the Neighbourhood of the Streets,
over which they presided; so that as those who governed the <i>Wards</i>
were called <i>Curatores</i>, so they who governed the Streets were called
<i>Vico-Magistri</i>. ’Tis very probable, that these Magistrates had some
Soldiers under their Command to prevent Robberies, and other Outrages
committed in the Night, as <i>Old Rome</i> had its <i>Vigils</i>, or Watchmen,
who were all Soldiers. There were two, three,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A14" id="Page_Page_A14">14</a></span> or four <i>Vico-Magistri</i>
appointed over every Street at <i>Rome</i>: At <i>Constantinople</i> every <i>Ward</i>
had but five, so that the whole Number of them is Seventy; although
my Author in his <i>Summary View of the City</i>, which follows hereafter,
reckons no more than sixty five.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="chapter" id="THE_SECOND_WARD">The Second <i>Ward</i>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>second</i> Ward, <i>after an easy, and almost imperceptible Ascent
above its Level from the lesser Theatre, falls with a deep Precipice
down to the Sea. This</i> Ward <i>contains in it, the Great Church of St.</i>
Sophia; <i>the Old Church; the Senate-House; a Tribunal with</i> Porphyry
<i>Steps; the</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Zeuxippus; <i>a Theatre; an Amphitheatre;
thirty four Streets; ninety eight large Houses; four great</i> Portico’s;
<i>thirteen private Baths; four private Mills, and four</i> Gradus. <i>It has
also one</i> Curator, <i>one</i> Vernaculus, <i>thirty five</i> Collegiati, <i>and
five</i> Vico-Magistri.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The great Church of St.</i> Sophia.] This Church, some say, was built by
<i>Constantine</i>, others by <i>Constantius</i>. It was afterwards burnt down,
and rebuilt by <i>Justinian</i>, and was then look’d upon as the finest and
most beautiful Church in the whole World. <i>Periander</i>, and others,
whose Works are still extant, have described at large the Delicacy
and Magnificence of this wonderful Piece of Architecture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A15" id="Page_Page_A15">15</a></span> <i>Evagrius</i>
writes, that this Church measured in Length a Hundred and ninety Foot,
in Breadth a Hundred and fifteen; and that from the Pavement to the Top
of the <i>Cupola</i>, it was an Hundred and eighty Foot high.</p>

<p><i>The Old Church.</i>] I suppose the Author here means one of those
Churches which were built by <i>Constantine</i>, some of which are mentioned
by <i>Procopius</i>, in <i>Lib. de &AElig;dif. Justinian.</i></p>

<p><i>The Senate-House.</i>] In this Place they held their Senate, which, as
<i>Sozomen</i> affirms, was built by <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, where he
commanded the same yearly Solemnity to be celebrated on the <i>Calends</i>
of <i>Jan.</i> as was done at <i>Rome</i>. It was burnt down, upon a Sedition
occasioned by an Attempt to banish St. <i>Chrysostom</i> out of the City,
and was rebuilt, as <i>Procopius</i> tells us, with greater Splendor.</p>

<p><i>A Tribunal with</i> Porphyry <i>Steps</i>.] This Tribunal was made of
<i>Porphyry</i> Marble, which Word in <i>Latin</i>, signifies <i>Purple</i>, because
<i>Porphyry</i> Marble is of a <i>Purple</i> Colour.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Zeuxippus.] These <i>Bagnio’s</i> were famous for a
<i>Portico</i>, which run round the Houses and Shops adjoining to them.
There was a yearly Revenue assigned for lighting the Lamps of this
<i>Bagnio</i>, and repairing them. <i>Theodosius</i> in <i>Lib. de Op. Pub.</i>
writes thus; <i>Because there are many Houses and Shops adjoining the</i>
Portico’s <i>of</i> Zeuxippus, <i>we will and command, that the yearly
Income of the said Houses and Shops, without any Pretence or Excuse
to the contrary, be paid into our Imperial</i> Bagnio, <i>for purchasing
Lights, and for the Repairs of the said</i> Bagnio’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A16" id="Page_Page_A16">16</a></span> This Passage is
part of a Letter which he wrote to <i>Severinus</i>, <i>Prefect</i> of the
City, (not <i>Pr&aelig;tor</i>) as it stands in the <i>Codex Theodos. de Op. Pub.</i>
These <i>Bagnio’s</i> formerly stood near the Imperial Palace, and were
afterwards called the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of the <i>Numeri</i>, as <i>Nicephorus</i>
writes, <i>Lib.</i> IX. <i>Cap.</i> 9. <i>Sozomen</i> and <i>Socrates</i> take Notice of
the same <i>Bagnio’s</i>. I believe they were first built by <i>Zeuxippus</i>,
who persecuted the <i>Christians</i> at <i>Byzantium</i>, much about the
Time of <i>Nero</i>; and who among other of his Severities, forced St.
<i>Andrew</i> to fly to <i>Argyropolis</i>. If I mistake not, he was at that
Time Lieutenant of <i>Macedonia</i> and <i>Thrace</i>. These <i>Bagnio’s</i> were
enlarged and beautified by <i>Severus</i> the Emperor, for which Reason
they were afterwards called the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Severus</i>. After this
they were called <i>Balnea Numerorum</i>, because great Numbers of Soldiers
use to bath there. <i>Zosimus</i>, in his second Book writes, that these
<i>Bagnio’s</i> formerly stood in a <i>Peninsula</i>. In antient Times, says
he, <i>Constantinople</i> had a Port at the End of the <i>Bagnio’s</i>, which
were built by <i>Severus</i> the Emperor, when he was reconciled to the
<i>Byzantians</i>, for opening the Gates of the City to <i>Niger</i>, his Enemy.
<i>Suidas</i> says, that a Poet named <i>Christodorus</i>, celebrated the
Statues and Images of <i>Zeuxippus</i> in Verse, among which he is very
particular in the Praises of the Statue of <i>Hesiod</i>. <i>Procopius</i>, in
his First Book, <i>de &AElig;dif. Justinian.</i> tells us, that these <i>Bagnio’s</i>
were rebuilt by <i>Justinian</i>, but were called the <i>Zeuxippum</i>, because
in this Place they used to run their <i>Horses in Pairs</i>, as the Word
<i>Zeuxippus</i> signifies in the <i>Greek</i>. St. <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> takes
Notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A17" id="Page_Page_A17">17</a></span> of them in his Oration to the <i>Arians</i>, and in another which
he made <i>concerning himself</i>. I am not, says he, taking a Journey to a
new <i>Jerusalem</i>, that is to the <i>Zeuxippum</i>; for that Place was laid
in Ashes in the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>. The <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Severus</i>, as
<i>Cedrinus</i> relates, which were call’d the <i>Zeuxippum</i>, were consumed
by Fire. In this Place was a very delightful Variety of Prospects. All
the ingenious Contrivances of Art were here expressed in Marble and
Stone, and the most elaborate Workmanship of Antiquity. In short, the
Designs here were so matchless and inimitable, that they seemed to want
nothing but a Soul to animate, and inform them. Among other surprizing
Pieces of antient Skill, was the Statue of old <i>Homer</i>. The Figure was
finished very naturally, and in his Looks might be observed a great
Thoughtfulness, with a Mixture of much Uneasiness and Trouble. This
Place was also beautified with brazen Pillars, which had been here set
up in Honour of those great Personages, who had been renowned for their
Learning or Virtue, through the whole World.</p>

<p><i>An Amphitheatre.</i>] This stands near the Sea Shore. You must pass by
it, as you go to the Imperial Palace, and the Port of <i>Julian</i>, between
which Places there were formerly Lime Kilns, which were commanded to be
filled up by <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>, as the Reader may see in <i>Lib.
ult. Cod. Theod.</i> <i>We will and command</i>, says he, <i>that all Lime-kilns,
standing on any Ground, between the Sea Shore, the Amphitheatre, and
the Port of St.</i> Julian, <i>be entirely demolished, for the Benefit and
Health of our most great and magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A18" id="Page_Page_A18">18</a></span> City</i>, and <i>by Reason of the
Nearness they stand to our Imperial Palace; and we do hereby prohibit
all Persons whatsoever for the future, to burn any Lime in those

<p><i>The House of</i> Pulcheria Augusta.] This Lady was the Sister of

her Brother was dead, she married <i>Martian</i>, and made him Emperor.
<i>Zonaras</i>, <i>Cedrinus</i>, <i>Zosimus</i>, <i>Nicephorus</i>, and other Historians

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The</i> Miliarium Aureum.] <i>Cedrinus</i>, speaking of the <i>Miliarium
Aureum</i>, writes thus: Under the Roof of the <i>Miliarium Aureum</i> were
placed the Statues of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, and his Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A20" id="Page_Page_A20">20</a></span> with
a Cross between them. Behind him stands <i>Trajan</i>, and near his Mother
is the Statue of <i>&AElig;lius Hadrianus</i> on Horseback. There is a Clock
here, which was set up by <i>Justinian</i>. There was also a <i>Miliarium
Aureum</i> at <i>Rome</i>, erected in the <i>Forum</i> by <i>Augustus</i>, from whence
they used to adjust the Distances of Places, and the Mensuration
of Miles, all the Roads of <i>Italy</i> meeting at the Foot of it, as
’tis observed by <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Dion</i>, <i>P. Victor</i>, and others. Yet
<i>&AElig;milius Macer</i> is of another Opinion. A Mile, says he, is not to be
computed from the <i>Miliarium</i>, but from the Houses, upon the Skirts
of the City, to the Place to which you measure. As then there was a
<i>Miliarium Aureum</i> at <i>Rome</i>, so there was at <i>Constantinople</i>, which
imitated <i>Old Rome</i> as near as it could; tho’ at <i>Rome</i> it was built
in the Figure of a Pillar, at <i>Constantinople</i> it was another kind of
Building, as is evident from what is above-mentioned by <i>Cedrinus</i>;
and is also attested by <i>Suidas</i>, who writes, that under the Roof of
the <i>Miliarium</i>, stood the Cross, the Figures of <i>Constantine</i> and
<i>Helena</i>, the Image of <i>Fortune</i>, and many other Statues. He calls it
not the <i>Miliarium</i>, but the <i>Milium</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Augusteum.] This was a large Pillar of Brass, erected by
<i>Justinian</i>, as <i>Cedrinus</i> relates, who tells us, that in the fifteenth
Year of the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>, was finished the great brazen
Pillar, which is called the <i>Augusteum</i>. Upon it was placed the Statue
of <i>Justinian</i> on Horseback, holding in his Right Hand an Apple, in
Imitation of a Globe, to signify that the whole World was subject to
his Government. He sat with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A21" id="Page_Page_A21">21</a></span> Right Hand stretched out, pointing to
the <i>Persians</i> to stand off, and not to approach his Dominions. All the
Coverings of the Passage of Entrance into the Imperial Palace, were
made of gilded Brass. This is still called the Brazen Passage, as the
Pillar is call’d the <i>Augusteum</i>. <i>Procopius</i> speaks largely of it in
his Oration <i>de &AElig;dif. Justin.</i> where he writes, that not the Pillar,
but the Place where the Pillar stood, was called the <i>Augusteum</i>, as
it was also the <i>Macellum</i>. The principal Pillar, says he, is to be
admired for its Size, yet is it no regular and uniform Structure, but
made of Stones of a vast Compass. The Pedestal and Top of it is covered
with the most refined Brass, which by cramping its Stones together,
does at the same Time both strengthen and adorn it. The Brass, as to
its Lustre, is not much inferior to pure Gold, and at least of equal
Worth and Beauty with the finest Silver. At the Top of this Pillar was
placed a very large Horse cast in Brass, facing the East, wonderful
in his Kind, in a walking Posture, with his Head bending downwards,
lifting up his near Fore-Foot, as though he would paw the Ground.
His Off-Foot is fixed to the Pedestal, on which he stands; and his
Hind-Feet are so closely contracted, as if he was rising upon his
Speed. Upon him sits the Statue of the Emperor in Brass, whom they call
<i>Achilles</i>, because he is somewhat like him. He has no Boots, but his
Feet are bound round with a kind of Sandals. He is armed with a radiant
Breast-plate and Head-piece, and looks, you would fancy, as if he were
marching, in a war-like Posture, against the <i>Persians</i>. In his left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A22" id="Page_Page_A22">22</a></span>
Hand he bears a Globe, by which ’tis signified, that the Earth and the
Sea is subject to his Power. He is not equipped either with Sword nor
Spear. There’s a Cross fixed upon the Globe, intimating, that under its
auspicious Influence, he arrived to the Imperial Dignity; and that all
Success in War is to be attributed to the Omnipotency of the Saviour
of Mankind. His Right Hand, which is open, is stretched Eastward, and
seems to forbid the barbarous Nations to approach his Territories.
Below this Place, stands the <i>Forum</i> called <i>Augustum</i>. This <i>Forum</i>
stands before the Imperial Palace; ’tis surrounded with Pillars, and
the Inhabitants call it <i>Augustum</i>. Eastward from hence stands the
<i>Curia</i>, or <i>Pr&aelig;torium</i>, which was built by <i>Justinian</i>, where the
old <i>Romans</i>, in the Beginning of the new Year used, as <i>Suidas</i>
observes, to perform a solemn Festival. <i>Phavorinus</i> relates, that the
Flesh-Market was the same with the <i>Augusteum</i>. It was so called, says
<i>Suidas</i>, because the <i>Curatores</i>, and <i>Senastophori</i> of the <i>Wards</i>,
used every Year, on the <i>Ides</i> of <i>October</i>, to dance in Honour of
<i>Augustus</i>, or because the Statues of <i>Constantine</i>, and <i>Helena</i> his
Mother, were erected there.</p>

<p><i>A</i> Basilica.] This was one of the most magnificent <i>Basilica’s</i> in
the World, which <i>Cedrinus</i> takes Notice of, when he tells us, that a
Fire began at the Middle of the <i>Chalcopratia</i>, which consumed both
the <i>Portico’s</i> before mentioned, all the neighbouring Buildings, and
the <i>Basilica</i>, which contained a Collection of a Hundred and twenty
Thousand Books. There was a Curiosity very particular in this Library,
which was the Gut of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A23" id="Page_Page_A23">23</a></span> a Dragon, on which were inscribed in Golden
Characters, the <i>Iliads</i> and <i>Odysses</i> of <i>Homer</i>, with the <i>History</i>
of the Atchievements of other <i>Heroes</i>. The Roof of this <i>Basilica</i> was
supported with many Ranges of Pillars, as we see at present in some
Churches, which are many of them built after the same Manner with the
<i>Basilica’s</i>. One of these <i>Basilica’s</i> is described by <i>Virgil</i>, in
his seventh <i>&AElig;neid</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In these <i>Basilica’s</i> they used to plead, and admit to Audience publick
Ambassadors; and, indeed, most of the publick Affairs were transacted
here. This I am speaking of was finely gilded, and made of a delicate
Marble. <i>Theodosius</i>, in his Letters Mandatory to <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Prefect</i>
of the City, means this <i>Basilica</i>, in the following Words: <i>We will
and command, that the</i> Basilica <i>gilt with Gold, and shining with
Marble, be no Ways shaded or darkened with Statues, or Pictures placed
before it</i>. I believe <i>Zonaras</i> understands the same Building in his
<i>Leo Magnus</i>, where he says, that the Building called the <i>Domus
Maxima</i>, in which the Senate, and some of the principal Citizens met
to deliberate upon publick Affairs, was burnt down; nay, that the
Emperor himself came thither in solemn Pomp, when he entered upon his
Consular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A24" id="Page_Page_A24">24</a></span> Dignity. It was a Work of surprising Beauty and Splendor.
<i>Justinian</i> tells us in his 81st <i>Novel</i>, that the inferior Judges used
to sit there in small Apartments. <i>Suidas</i> writes, that this <i>Basilica</i>
stood behind the <i>Miliarium</i>, and that there was placed in it, amidst
several others, a golden Statue. Among other Curiosities here, there
is an Elephant, cast at the Expence of <i>Severus</i>, on the Account of a
certain Banker, who killed his Keeper, and gave his Body to be devoured
by a wild Beast; which the Elephant seeing, in a Rage slew the Banker.
<i>Severus</i>, to preserve the Memory of the Fact, ordered the Elephant and
his Keeper to be cast in Brass, and both the Figures, in the Consulship
of <i>Julian</i>, were carried to <i>Constantinople</i>, and placed in the
<i>Basilica</i>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> Nympheum.] This, as <i>Zonaras</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i> tell us, was a
spacious Building, in which they used to celebrate Marriage, when they
had not Houses large enough for that Purpose. <i>Suidas</i> mentions, that
in the <i>Forum</i> of this <i>Ward</i>, there was a Spring continually running,
which filled the <i>Bagnio</i> of the <i>Nympheum</i>. <i>Theodosius</i>, in another
Letter to <i>Cyrus</i> above-mentioned, writes thus. <i>I command you, by
Virtue of your prefectorial Authority, to appoint, as you shall judge
convenient, what Share of Water be allotted to our Imperial</i> Bagnio’s,
<i>and what Quantity may be sufficient for the</i> Bagnio’s <i>of the</i>
Nympheum.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Portico <i>of</i> Phanio.] <i>Suidas</i> tells us, that <i>Phanio</i> is a
Place where they carried the Filth of the City. This, probably, is
the same <i>Portico</i>, which the Emperor <i>Zeno</i> tells us, reached from
the <i>Miliarium</i>, as far as the <i>Capitol</i>, and is supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A25" id="Page_Page_A25">25</a></span> with four
Ranges of Pillars, between which he allows, in his <i>Cod. de Priv.
&AElig;dif.</i> a Privilege to build little Shops.</p>

<p><i>A Marble Galley.</i>] This was set up in Memory of a Victory, which
<i>Zosimus</i>, in his fifth Book tells us, <i>Trajutus</i>, Admiral of
<i>Arcadius</i>’s Fleet, obtain’d over <i>Gaina</i>, near <i>Chersonesus</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Church of St.</i> Menna.] This Person was an <i>Egyptian Soldier</i>, who
suffer’d Martyrdom under <i>Dioclesian</i>, in <i>Phrygia</i>: This Church was
built by <i>Constantine</i>, who, as <i>Eusebius</i> reports in <i>his Life, Book</i>
III. <i>Chap.</i> 4. built also other Churches in honour of the <i>Martyrs</i>.</p>

<p><i>A</i> Stadium.] This was a square <i>Area</i>, design’d, as <i>Suidas</i>
observes, for Martial Exercises. The <i>Grecians</i> generally made them
two hundred Foot long, and sometimes more. This <i>Area</i> was surrounded
with a <i>Portico</i>, and Pillars. The <i>Grecians</i> used them sometimes in
Merriment, and Dancing, and sometimes in more manly Diversions, as
Wrestling, fighting at Gauntlets, <i>&amp;c.</i> The <i>Portico</i>, on the South
Side of it, was double Wall’d, to secure it from the Violence of the
Northern Storms. In the <i>Stadium</i>, stood an <i>Ephebeum</i>, with Seats all
round it, where they held publick Disputations in Philosophy, and where
Youth was train’d up in Literature, and Science. In ancient Times, when
Books were scarce, they used to improve themselves by Dispute, and
Argumentation. On each Side of the <i>Ephebeum</i>, there were <i>Bagnio’s</i>,
in which the Combatants anointed themselves, before they enter’d the
Lifts. The <i>Stadium</i> fac’d the Sea, as <i>Procopius</i> observes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A26" id="Page_Page_A26">26</a></span> in his
Book <i>de &AElig;dif Justin.</i> In a Place, says he, near the Sea, at present
call’d the <i>Stadium</i>, (a Place formerly appropriated to Games, and
Martial Exercises) <i>Justinian</i>, and his Consort <i>Theodora</i>, built some
large Hospitals.</p>

<p><i>The Stairs of</i> Timasius.] These were three Steps, at the Foot of a
Hill, leading down to the Sea, which were built by <i>Timasius</i>. ’Tis
very probable, that they were made of Marble, and were something
remarkable, because my Author takes Notice of them. There was Custom
paid at these Stairs, for the Repairs of the City <i>Aqueduct</i>; as
appears from the <i>Cod. Theod. Aqu&aelig;duc.</i> <i>We will</i>, says he, <i>that all
the Customs, which are, or may be collected at the Stairs of this our
City of</i> Constantinople, <i>be expended in the Repairs of the common
Aque-duct</i>. I am of Opinion, that this Custom was payable by such Ships
as unladed their Freight there. <i>Justinian</i> in his 159ᵗʰ <i>Novel</i> takes
notice of a Clause in the Codicil of the Will of <i>Hierius</i>, where he
bequeaths to his Kinsman <i>Hierius</i> the Suburbs <i>Coparium</i>, with all
the Stairs thereunto belonging. <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, That in the Reign
of <i>Copronymus</i> the Emperor, the Sea was froze by the Severity of the
Weather, and that upon a sudden Thaw, a large Cake of Ice bore against,
and demolish’d the Stairs of the Imperial Palace at <i>Constantinople</i>.
<i>Timasius</i>, who built these Stairs, was General of the Infantry to
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>, and was train’d up in the Art of War from the
Time of <i>Valens</i> the Emperor. At last being falsely, and injuriously
accused by <i>Eutropius</i>, the Chamberlain of <i>Arcadius</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A27" id="Page_Page_A27">27</a></span> was banish’d
into <i>Oasis</i>. <i>Zosimus</i>, speaking of him in his <i>fifth Book</i>, says,
that he was the Father of <i>Syagrius</i>, who was entitled <i>Pater Patri&aelig;</i>.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="THE_FIFTH_WARD">The Fifth <i>Ward</i>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>fifth</i> Ward, <i>a great Part of it is full of Windings, and
Turnings, and is lengthen’d by an adjoining Plain. There are many
useful Buildings in this</i> Ward, <i>which contains the</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i>
Honorius; <i>the Cistern of</i> Theodosius; <i>the</i> Prytaneum; <i>the</i> Bagnio’s

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The Cistern of</i> Theodosius.] This Cistern was a subterraneous Cavern,
arched at top, which was supply’d, not with Spring, but with Rain Water
only. <i>Petrus Gyllius</i> in his <i>Antiquities</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>, tells
us, that when he resided at that City, he discover’d a subterraneous
Cistern there; which he shewed to the Proprietors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A28" id="Page_Page_A28">28</a></span> Land where it
was, who, before, were intirely ignorant of it. It was, says he, 336
Foot in length, 182 Foot broad, and 224 in compass. The Roof of it was
supported with Marble Pillars, placed at twelve Foot distance from each
other. Every Pillar was near nine Foot high. They stand, lengthways,
in twelve Ranges; broad-ways, in twenty eight. In Winter-time, when
the <i>Aque-duct</i> pours itself with more Violence into it, it fills up
to the Middle of the Capitals of the Columns. It has sometimes Fish in
it, which the Master, who overlooks it, skiffing about in a small Boat,
kills with a Spear.</p>

<p><i>A</i> Prytaneum.] There was at <i>Athens</i> a Tower call’d the <i>Prytaneum</i>,
where their Senators, and wise Men met upon publick Affairs, and where
Persons, who deserv’d well of the Commonwealth, were maintain’d at the
Publick Charge, as ’tis observ’d by <i>Cicero</i>, <i>Lib. primo de Orat.</i> In
Conformity to <i>Athens</i>, there was also at <i>Constantinople</i> a spacious
Building, near the Imperial Cistern, where a Person, eminent in Wisdom
and Learning, instructed twelve young Men in such Arts and Sciences,
as might qualify them to be serviceable to the Publick. <i>Cedrinus</i> in
his History of <i>Leo Isaurus</i>, writes, that, near the Royal Cistern,
there was a venerable Pyle of Building, over which there presided
a Master, who had under him, according to ancient Custom, twelve
Scholars, of sober Life, and a good Share of Learning. These, when
they had run through the whole Compass of human Literature, apply’d
themselves very diligently to the Study of Divinity, and were had in
so high Estimation, that the Emperors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A29" id="Page_Page_A29">29</a></span> themselves look’d upon it as an
Injury to their Character, to transact any thing of Importance, without
their Advice. This Institution was afterwards suppress’d by <i>Leo</i>.
<i>Zonaras</i> is more express, and large upon this Occasion; there was,
says he, a House in the <i>Basilica</i>, near the <i>Forum &AElig;rarium</i>, large
enough for a Palace, in which were reported many ancient <i>Manuscripts</i>
of Human, and Divine Learning, and where a sufficient Maintenance was
allow’d for a Person of distinguish’d Knowledge whom they call’d the
<i>Oecumenical Doctor</i>. He had under him twelve <i>Fellows</i>, who lived at
the publick Cost, and instructed such as desired to be their Pupils.
The Emperors also, concludes he, consulted them in the most arduous
Affairs of State. But <i>Leo</i> the Emperor, when he could not prevail
with them to declare themselves the same profess’d Enemies to Images,
in Church-worship, with himself, destroy’d them, and their Library,
in the Night by Fire. As therefore it was customary in other Nations
to maintain at the common Charge Persons who might prove useful to
the Publick, so was it here; and therefore, I conceive, that as the
<i>Prytaneum</i> at <i>Constantinople</i> took its Name from that of <i>Athens</i>, so
was it originally instituted for Purposes, much of the same Nature.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Eudocia.] These <i>Bagnio’s</i> were so call’d, because
they were built by <i>Eudocia</i> the Wife of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>.
Before she was converted to the Christian Faith, she was called

<p><i>The</i> Strategium.] This, I look upon, to be the Place, where the
General’s Troops liv’d, and pitch’d their Tents. Here was the <i>Forum</i>
of <i>Theodosius</i>, and the <i>Thebean Obelisk</i> which was brought from
<i>Thebes</i> in <i>&AElig;gypt</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>, and there squat’d.</p>

<p><i>The Granaries of</i> Troas.] These Granaries contain’d the Corn, and
other Commodities which were brought from <i>Troas</i>; as those Granaries
were call’d the Granaries of <i>Alexandria</i>, in which the Corn was laid
up, that was brought from <i>Alexandria</i>. <i>Troas</i> is a Countrey of
<i>Phrygia</i>, situate near the <i>Hellespont</i>, not far from <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Granary of</i> Valens.] This was built by <i>Valens</i>. It is probably
the same Granary, in which was placed the Statue of <i>Manaim</i>, who
march’d his Army against the <i>Scythians</i>. There was kept here a brazen
Bushel, which was the common Standard, by which Corn was bought, and
sold. <i>Valens</i> commanded that twelve Bushels of Wheat should be sold at
the Price of an <i>Aureus</i>, (in <i>English</i> Coin 17<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> <i>ob. qua.</i>)
and commanded a Sailor’s Hand to be cut off, who had eluded the Force
of that Law by Tricks, and Evasions, and in Memory of the Fact, order’d
a Brazen Hand to be hung up in the Granary.</p>

<p>They had also at <i>Constantinople</i> Store-houses where they reposited
their Gold, and Silver, and Jewels. For <i>Paulus</i> a Lawyer informs us,
that ’twas customary to lay up in Store-houses the most valuable Part
of their Estates. <i>Lampridius</i> also mentions some Store-houses built
by <i>Alexander</i>, where private Persons, who had no Conveniency in their
own Houses, used to lay up their Gold, their Silver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A31" id="Page_Page_A31">31</a></span> their Jewels, and
their Corn, and that the Masters of the Store-houses were obliged to
keep them safe at their Peril.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Prosphorian <i>Port</i>.] Here they used to unlade all kinds of
Provisions; for the Word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσφορὸν</span> in the <i>Greek</i> signifies
any thing that is brought to Market.</p>

<p><i>The Stairs of</i> Chalcedon.] These were a convenient Descent by Steps,
where they went on Board, when they sail’d for <i>Chalcedon</i>, which lay
over against <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><i>Two Flesh-Markets.</i>] All kind of Provisions were sold here.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Porphyry <i>Pillar of</i> Constantine.] This Pillar stood in the

<i>Zonaras</i>, speaking of <i>Nicephorus Phocas</i> the Emperor, has this
Passage: The People curse <i>Nicephorus</i> even to the pav’d <i>Forum</i>, in
which is erected the round <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar. <i>Cedrinus</i> in his History
tells us, that <i>Constantine</i> in the twenty fourth Year of his Reign,
built a <i>Forum</i> with two <i>Rostrums</i>, or Pleading Desks made in the
form of Pulpits, and that he plac’d in the <i>Forum</i>, a Pillar which
he brought from <i>Rome</i>. It was one solid Piece of <i>Porphyry</i> Marble,
and was bound with three <i>Fasci&aelig;</i>, or Wreaths of Brass round it, with
Inscriptions upon them. On the Top of it he erected his own Statue,
with this Inscription, <i>CONSTANTINUS</i>. It blazed like the Sun, was
made by the famous <i>Phidias</i>, and was brought from <i>Athens</i>. Upon the
Pedestal of the Pillar were carved in <i>Basso Relievo</i>, the seven and
twelve Baskets of Fragments, which were taken up in the Miracles of the
<i>Loaves</i> and <i>Fishes</i>, and beneath were inscribed the following Verses.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Zonaras</i> mentions the same Thing, tho’ in different Words. He placed,
says he, meaning <i>Constantine</i>, the round <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar which he
brought from <i>Rome</i>, in the <i>Forum</i>, paved with square Stones. For
this Reason it was called by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A33" id="Page_Page_A33">33</a></span> the <i>Greeks</i> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πλακότον</span>. At the
Top of the Pillar he placed his own Statue in Brass, which for its
Largeness, and the Exquisiteness of its Work, was scarce to be matched
in the whole World, as being finished to the Life, by an antient and
eminent Statuary. It was thought that it was originally designed for
<i>Apollo</i>, and brought from <i>Troy</i>; but <i>Constantine</i> gave it his own
Name, making some Alteration by fattening some of those Nails in the
Head of it, with which the <i>Jews</i> crucified the <i>Lord of Life</i>. This
Statue continued standing upon the Pillar till very lately, when in
the Reign of <i>Alexius Comnenus</i>, it was thrown down by an Earthquake,
and crushed some People to Death. <i>Nicephorus</i> in the Fourth Book,
<i>Chap.</i> 8. of his <i>Eccles. Hist.</i> gives a better Description of it. He
built, says he, a large <i>Porphyry</i> Pillar, upon which he placed his own
Statue, holding in his right Hand a Globe, with a Cross fixed upon it.
By this Symbol he intimated, that by Virtue of that invincible Trophy
the Cross, the whole Earth and Sea was subject to his Power. <i>Gyllius</i>
writes, that this Pillar was made of eight Stones, and that at the
Joints of it, it was covered round with Wreathed Laurels made of Brass,
so that you could not perceive where it was cemented; but that upon
the Removal of the Brass-work, you might easily discern that it was a
jointed Structure, and that the Number of the Stones might be plainly
seen. This Pillar is eighty six Foot high, besides the <i>Basis</i>, the
Steps, and the Pedestal.</p>

<p><i>The Senate-House, in the same Place.</i>] This Building stood on the
North Side of the <i>Forum</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A34" id="Page_Page_A34">34</a></span> <i>Constantine</i>. The Senators and principal
Men of the City used to assemble here upon publick Affairs, and
the Emperor took upon him in this Place the Consular Habit. It was
curiously beautified with Brass, and <i>Porphyry</i> Marble. <i>Zonaras</i>, and
<i>Cedrinus</i> tell us, that in the Reign of <i>Leo</i> the <i>Great</i>, it was
destroyed by Fire.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Neorian <i>Port</i>.] This was the Haven, or Dock, where they built
their shipping, from whence the Gate, which hands near it, is called
by some Writers, the Gate of the <i>Neorium</i>; but by <i>Zonaras</i>, and
<i>Cedrinus</i>, as will appear in my Notes upon the twelfth <i>Ward</i>, it was
called <i>Porta Aurea</i>, the gilded or beautiful Gate. Some have given it
the Name of the Imperial Gate, because it joins to the Palace.</p>

<p><i>The Stairs</i> of Syc&aelig;na.] These are the Stairs upon the Shore, from
whence you go off to a neighbouring Island called <i>Syc&aelig;na</i> but which at
present is called <i>Pera</i>. In the Creek here, there are many Thousand
small Boats, more in Number than at <i>Venice</i>. They are generally called
Ferry-boats, because they <i>carry</i> their Fare to and fro’ across the
River.</p>

<p><i>One large</i> Portico.] This <i>Portico</i> reached as far as the <i>Forum</i> of
<i>Constantine</i>, and was burnt down in a tumultuous Manner, in the Reign
of <i>Justinian</i>.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The Church of St.</i> Irene.] This Church stood in a Street of this
<i>Ward</i>, which was called <i>Taurus</i>. It was called the Church of St.
<i>Irene</i>, <i>i. e.</i> of Peace; and which, as <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Cedrinus</i>
inform us, was built by <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, and burnt down in
the Reign of <i>Justinian</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A36" id="Page_Page_A36">36</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Church of St.</i> Anastasia.] The Reliques of St. <i>Anastasia</i>, in
the first Year of <i>Leo</i> the <i>Great</i>, were brought from <i>Syrmium</i> to
<i>Constantinople</i>, and reposited in this Church which was built by the
Catholicks, because St. <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> had there revived the
Doctrine of the <i>Holy Trinity</i>, or as <i>Sozomen</i> reports, because a
Woman big with Child falling from a Gallery over the Church-porch died
upon the Spot, and revived by the Prevalency of the Prayers of the
Congregation.</p>

<p>But it seems to me more agreeable to Truth, that there were at
<i>Constantinople</i> two Churches which went under this Name: One was the
Church of the <i>Novatians</i>, which was pull’d down by the <i>Arians</i>, and
which was afterwards rebuilt by them, as <i>Sozomen</i> observes, <i>Lib.</i> IV.
<i>Cap.</i> 19, and was therefore call’d the Church of St. <i>Anastasia</i>. The
other was so call’d, from the Revival of the Doctrine of the Trinity,
just mentioned. The Church here meant was anciently the House of
<i>Nicobulus</i>, where St. <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> was hospitably entertained
by him, as appears in his Oration to the Hundred and fifty Bishops.
This House was afterwards made a Church, and became a most magnificent
<i>Basilica</i>. But <i>Sozomen</i> tells us, <i>Lib.</i> V. <i>Cap.</i> 5. That the Church
was so called for the Reason above-mentioned. <i>Martian</i>, one of the
Principal, and most wealthy Citizens, built there a large and beautiful
Church. The Reliques of <i>Anastasia</i>, were reposited there, because the
Church bore her Name.</p>

<p><i>The Pillar of</i> Theodosius, <i>which is ascended on the Inside by Winding
Stairs</i>.] <i>Zonaras</i>, in his Life of <i>Justinian</i>, writes concerning this
Pillar as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A37" id="Page_Page_A37">37</a></span> follows: In the seventeenth Year of his Reign, says he, the
great Pillar placed before the Porch of the great Church was finished,
upon which he placed his own Statue on Horseback. In the same Place had
stood formerly the Pillar of <i>Theodosius</i>, supporting a silver Statue,
made at the Cost of his Son <i>Arcadius</i>. This Statue was seven Thousand
four hundred Pound in Weight. <i>Justinian</i> took down the Statue, and
demolished the Pillar, and laid them both up; so that the Statue,
with the Stones of the Pillar, is to be seen at this Day. As the
Treatise, I am, upon was wrote when this Pillar was standing, it must
of Consequence be wrote before the Time of <i>Justinian</i>. <i>Cedrinus</i>, in
his Life of <i>Zeno</i>, speaks of this Pillar in another Manner, or else
he is speaking of another Pillar. In the Street called <i>Taurus</i>, says
he, <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i> erected a Pillar, on which was carved
the History of his Battles with the <i>Scythians</i>, and the Trophies of
his Success. This Pillar, continues he, has Winding-Stairs within it.
At the Top of it, in a Place where two Ways meet, sat <i>Theodosius</i> on
Horseback, with his right Hand stretched towards the City, and pointing
downwards to the Trophies carved upon it. This Pillar, with the Statue,
was thrown down by an Earthquake in the fourth Year of the Reign of
<i>Zeno</i> the Emperor. The same Historian, speaking of <i>Anastasius</i>,
says, that he ordered to be melted down many of the Statues, and other
Curiosities set up by <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, out of which his own
Statue was made, which he placed upon the Pillar in the <i>Taurus</i>. For
before the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A38" id="Page_Page_A38">38</a></span> placed there, the
Pillar of <i>Anastasius</i> was thrown down, and dashed to Pieces by an
Earthquake.</p>

<p><i>Two large Equestrian Statues.</i>] One of these was the Statue of
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i>. The other is unknown.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Corosia.] These Bagnio’s took their Name from
<i>Corosia</i>, the Daughter of <i>Valens</i> the Emperor, as <i>Sozomen</i> observes
in the Ninth Chapter of his Sixth Book. <i>Martian</i>, says he, a Man of
consummate Learning, and great Austerity of Life, who had formerly
been one of the Emperor’s Life-Guard, but at that Time a Priest, was
a <i>Novatian</i>, and Tutor to <i>Anastasius</i> and <i>Corosia</i>, the Son and
Daughter of <i>Valens</i>, in the Rudiments of Grammar. He adds, that there
were some <i>Bagnio’s</i> at <i>Constantinople</i> that were named from them.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The two Churches of</i> C&aelig;nopolis, <i>and</i> Omon&aelig;a.] I am of Opinion, that
the first of these Churches took its Name from some Place in the City.
Perhaps it was call’d so from a Spring without the <i>Porta Aurea</i>,
which had made the Ground foul, and oozy. <i>Leo</i>, before he came to
the Government, as the Story goes, anointed the Eyes of a blind Man
with the Dirt of that Place, and he recover’d his Sight. When he
arriv’d afterwards to the Imperial Dignity, he dedicated a Church
to the <i>Virgin Mary</i>, who foretold his Accession to the Government.
<i>Nicephorus</i>, in <i>Lib.</i> XV. <i>Cap.</i> 25. <i>Hist. Ecclesiast.</i> (and
<i>Procopius</i> confirms it) says, that in the Suburbs, which was called
<i>Fons</i>, or the Spring, <i>Justinian</i> repair’d the Church of the <i>Blessed
Virgin</i>. The other Church is call’d <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὁμόνοια</span>, or the Church of
Concord; because, probably in the Times of Heathenism, the Temple of
<i>Concord</i> stood there; as there were no less than three such Temples at
<i>Rome</i>. One of which was dedicated to her by <i>M. Furius Camillus</i>, upon
a Suppression of a Military Tumult; the second by <i>M. Manlius Pr&aelig;tor</i>,
upon quelling such another Tumult in <i>Gaul</i>; and the third in the
<i>Forum Romanum</i>, near the <i>Gr&aelig;costasis</i>, by <i>L. Opimius</i> the <i>Consul</i>,
upon the Defeat of <i>Gracchus</i> and his Party, in Opposition to the
strongest Resentments of the People; so that the Inscription over this
Temple was <i>Opus Vecordi&aelig;</i>, and not <i>Concordi&aelig;</i>. There was also another
Temple dedicated to <i>Concord</i>, which was either built, or repair’d by
<i>Livia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A41" id="Page_Page_A41">41</a></span> Augusta</i>, as is observed by St. <i>Austin.</i> <i>Lib.</i> III. <i>Cap.</i>
2. <i>de Civit. Dei.</i> One of these Temples was repaired by <i>Constantine</i>
for Christian Worship, as is evident from an antient Inscription in the
<i>Lateran</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Granaries</i> of Alexandria.] There were yearly carried from
<i>Alexandria</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>, eight Millions of <i>Medimni</i> of Wheat,
(each <i>Medimnus</i> of <i>Attick</i> Measure consisted of six Bushels) for
which the Masters of the Ships by an Edict of <i>Justinian</i>, received
the Sum of ninety Thousand <i>Aurei</i>. There was antiently rais’d by
Order of the Senate, and the principal Inhabitants, the Sum of six
hundred and eleven Pounds in Gold, which was lodged in the Hands of the
<i>Prefect</i> of the City, for purchasing Provision; to which the Emperor
added another Import, for purchasing Corn from <i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Lib.</i>
III. <i>Cod. Theod. de Frumen. Urb. Constan.</i> This Corn, when brought to
<i>Constantinople</i>, was laid up in Granaries, which were therefore called
the Granaries of <i>Alexandria</i>.</p>

<p><i>The House of the most illustrious</i> Arcadia.] This Lady, as <i>Cedrinus</i>
relates, was the Daughter of <i>Arcadius</i>. She had another House in the
tenth <i>Ward</i>. <i>Arcadius</i> had by the Empress <i>Eudocia</i>, three Daughters,
<i>Pulcheria</i>, <i>Marina</i>, and <i>Arcadia</i>, who all lived in a State of
Celibacy.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Anastasia.] These <i>Bagnio’s</i> were so call’d from
<i>Anastasia</i>, the Daughter of <i>Valens</i>, as others were from her Sister
<i>Carosia</i> abovementioned. <i>Marcellinus</i>, in his <i>Seventeenth Book</i>
observes, that these <i>Bagnio’s</i> took their Name from <i>Anastasia</i>.
<i>Paulas Diaconus</i> tells us in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A42" id="Page_Page_A42">42</a></span> his <i>Thirteenth Book</i>, that there’s a
very large House in <i>Constantinople</i> called <i>Carya</i>, which signifies
a Nut: For, says he, there stands in the Porch of this House a
Nut-tree, on which, as the Report goes, St. <i>Achatius</i> suffered
Martyrdom. Upon this Account, there is also an Oratory built in the
same Place. <i>Procopius</i> also mentions a Man, who went to the <i>Bagnio’s</i>
of <i>Anastasia</i>, which took their Name, says he, from the Sister of
<i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Church of St.</i> Achatius.] This good Man suffered Death at
<i>Constantinople</i>, as I just observed, upon a Nut-tree, which
<i>Nicephorus</i> says, remained in the Middle of the Church, sacred to his
Memory in the Reign of <i>Arcadius</i>, though he was martyr’d in the Time
of <i>Dioclesian</i> an hundred Years before. For, speaking of <i>Procopius</i>
the Tyrant, The Church, says he, which was demolished with Age, was
rebuilt, and beautified by <i>Justinian</i>. And <i>Procopius</i> the Historian
tells us in <i>Lib. de &AElig;dif Just.</i> That <i>Justinian</i> rebuilt it from the
Ground, and that it cast such a Lustre, that it struck the Spectators
with Admiration, its Marble being very glossy, and white as Snow.
He adds farther, that this Church was called the <i>Martyrdom</i> of St.
<i>Achatius</i>, because he was buried there, which happened on the sixth of
<i>May</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Bagnio’s <i>of</i> Constantine.] <i>Gyllius</i> says they were the
<i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Constantius</i>, and which, indeed, are often mentioned
by <i>Sozomen</i>, <i>Socrates</i>, and <i>Suidas</i>; but ’tis more probable that
these <i>Bagnio’s</i> were built by <i>Constantine</i>, who was indefatigable in
beautifying the City with many Decorations.</p>

<p><i>The House of</i> Placidia Augusta.] This Lady was the Daughter of
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>, who afterwards resided in <i>Italy</i>, with her
Brother <i>Honorius</i>.</p>

<p><i>The House of</i> Augusta Eudocia.] She was the most learned Woman of
her Age, and wrote the Life of <i>Christ</i> in <i>Greek Hexameters</i>, after
the Manner of <i>Homer</i>. At last being suspected by her Husband of
Adultery, and divorc’d, she went to <i>Jerusalem</i>, but upon the Death of

<i>Cap.</i> 58. <i>de Vita Const.</i> says, that to perpetuate the Memory of
the <i>Apostles</i>, he began to build a Church, in the City called after
his own Name. When he had built the Church to a very great Height, he
beautify’d it with Stones of all Kinds, and inlay’d it with Variety of
the most delicate Marble, from the Pavement to the Top of the Church;
and having closed the Roof with Arches of the best Workmanship, he
gilded it over. The Top of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A45" id="Page_Page_A45">45</a></span> Church, on the Outside of it, was
cover’d with Brass, to secure it from the Violence of the Weather,
part of which was also gilded; so that the amazing Splendour of it,
reflected the Rays of the Sun to a very great Distance. The inward
part of the Church he cover’d with Net-work, which was artificially
made of Brass and Gold. Thus beautifully was the Church adorn’d by the
great Care and Application of the Emperor. Before it stood a spacious
Court, with an open Gallery round it. The Church and the Gallery were
wholly surrounded with <i>Portico’s</i>. The Palace, the <i>Bagnio’s</i>, the
Walks, and many Houses built for the Accommodation of those who look’d
after them, had all of them the Conveniency of some <i>Portico</i>. In
this Church was laid the Body of <i>Constantine</i>, in a golden Chest,
the twelve <i>Apostles</i> standing round his Tomb. This is attested by
<i>Socrates</i>. This Church was afterwards rebeautified by <i>Justinian</i>. For
<i>Procopius</i>, <i>Lib. de &AElig;dif. Just.</i> speaks of it thus: There was, says
he, an ancient Church at <i>Constantinople</i>, just sinking with Age. This
Church, for the Reverence he bore to it, was repair’d by <i>Justinian</i>,
where the Masons and Workmen found three wooden Chests or Coffins,
which proved by their Inscriptions, that the Bodies of St. <i>Luke</i>, St.
<i>Andrew</i> and <i>Timothy</i>, were interr’d there, and which were viewed by
<i>Justinian</i>, and the <i>Christians</i> of those Times, with the greatest
Admiration.</p>

<p><i>The Palace of</i> Flacilla.] If we read it <i>Falcilla</i>, it is meant of
another Daughter of <i>Arcadius</i>; if <i>Placilla</i>, she was the Wife of
<i>Theodosius the Great</i>, whom <i>Paulus Diaconus</i> calls <i>Flacilla</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A46" id="Page_Page_A46">46</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Brazen Bull.</i>] This Bull, <i>Cedrinus</i> writes, was brought from
<i>Troy</i>. There was, says he, a Stove in which St. <i>Antipas</i> the Martyr
was burnt to Death. Some are of Opinion, that this Stove was the
<i>Brazen Bull</i> here mention’d, which was invented by <i>Perillus</i>, who
was forced to undergo the same Torment by <i>Phalaris</i>, a cruel Tyrant
of <i>Agrigentum</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> relates, that <i>Phocas</i> the Tyrant was burnt
in a Bull, <i>i. e.</i> in a brazen Stove made in the Shape of a Bull,
brought from <i>Pergamus</i>, which Place gave its Name to a Place near
<i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Cistern of</i> Modestus.] <i>Modestus</i> was first chief Governour of
the East, and was afterwards, <i>Pr&aelig;fectus Pr&aelig;torio</i>, or General of
the Life-Guard to <i>Valens</i>. As he was an <i>Arian</i>, he persecuted the
Catholicks. Afterwards he was recovered from a dangerous Illness by the
Prayers of St. <i>Basil</i>, as ’tis recorded by <i>Gregory Nazianzen</i> in his
Funeral Oration upon him. I take this to be the same Person who built
the Cistern here mention’d.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="THE_TWELFTH_WARD">The Twelfth <i>Ward</i>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>twelfth</i> Ward, <i>from the Entrance of the City at the</i> Porta Aurea,
<i>is a long way upon the Level. ’Tis extended on the left Side of it
by a gentle Descent, and is bounded by the Sea. This</i> Ward <i>is better
guarded, and more handsomly beautified than any other, the Walls rising

<i>thirty four</i> Collegiati, <i>and five</i> Vico-Magistri.</p>

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The</i> Porta Aurea.] The <i>Greeks</i> call it <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὡραία</span> both on
the account of its own Beautifulness, and that of the neighbouring
Buildings; so that it is a palpable Mistake in those who call it <i>Porta
Neoria</i> from the Dock, which is near to it. I take this to be the same
Gate which <i>Zonaras</i> mentions in his Life of <i>Leo</i> the Philosopher.
He calls it the Western Gate of the Golden <i>Triclinium</i>, from whence
it is call’d the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, as is observ’d by <i>Nicetas</i> in his
Life of <i>Alexius Ducas, Marzulfus</i>, and in the <i>History</i> of their
Atchievements, after they had taken the City; as also by <i>Nicephorus
Gregoras</i>, in his <i>Treatise</i> entituled, <i>The Entry of</i> Michael
Pal&aelig;ologus <i>into the City</i>. In this Gate it is reported, the Elephants
were stabled, which were much like those with which <i>Theodosius</i>
made his publick Entry into <i>Constantinople</i>, as ’tis mention’d by
<i>Cedrinus</i>. Some Historians tell us, that they were transported to
<i>Constantinople</i> from the Temple of <i>Mars Atheniensis</i>. This Gate stood
Easterly, facing the Sea, and as <i>Nicephorus</i> observes, overlook’d the
Imperial Citadel through the City to a great Distance, and that from
thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A48" id="Page_Page_A48">48</a></span> you might look very far backwards into the Inland Countries.
This Gate, in a direct Line, was distant from the Sea-shore fourteen
thousand and seventy five Feet, so that the City was about three Miles
in Length.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Portico’s <i>of</i> Troas.] I believe these <i>Portico’s</i> took their
Name either from the People of <i>Troas</i>, who, while they continued
there, built them; or from some Part of the City so call’d, or because
some Goods and Merchandize were imported thither from <i>Troas</i>, as I
observed before of the Granaries of <i>Troas</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Column with winding Stairs on its Inside.</i>] Upon this Pillar was
erected the Statue of <i>Theodosius</i>, which, as <i>Zonaras</i> writes, was
near the <i>Porta Aurea</i>, and fell down in the Reign of <i>Leo Isaurus</i>.
<i>Gyllius</i> is of Opinion, that this was the Statue of <i>Arcadius</i>, that
the Shaft of it, with the Pedestal and Capital, consisted of twenty one
Stones; and adds, that the Battels of <i>Theodosius</i> were carv’d upon it.</p>

<h3 class="chapter" id="THE_THIRTEENTH_WARD">The Thirteenth <i>Ward</i>.</h3>

<p class="dropcap2">THE <i>thirteenth</i> Ward <i>is call’d the</i> Syc&aelig;ne Ward, <i>which is divided
from the City by a narrow Bay of the Sea, and maintains an Intercourse
with it by Boats, and small Vessels. It stands wholly upon the Side
of it, except a broad Tract of Land, which lies Level, at the Foot of

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The</i> Sycene Ward.] This <i>Ward</i> is a <i>Peninsula</i> divided from
<i>Constantinople</i> by a small Bay of the City. ’Tis at present call’d
<i>Galata</i>, or <i>Pera</i>. <i>Stephanus</i> (<i>de Urbibus</i>) tells us, that <i>Syc&aelig;</i>
is a small City over against New <i>Rome</i>, which in his Time was called
<i>Justiniana</i>. But <i>Justinian</i> himself, <i>Novel.</i> 59. <i>Cap.</i> 5. places it
so far within the new Walls of the City, that, as he says, it ought to
be looked upon as a Part of it. It was named by the <i>Greeks</i> <i>Syc&aelig;na</i>,
from the great Produce it bears of the best <i>Figs</i>, as is observed by
<i>Cedrinus</i> and <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i>. ’Tis not inhabited at present
by the <i>Franks</i>, for so the <i>Greeks</i> call the <i>Latines</i>. <i>Gyllius</i> is
of Opinion that it was called <i>Galata</i>, because <i>Brennus</i>, Captain
General of the <i>Gauls</i>, whom the <i>Greeks</i> call <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γαλάται</span>
marched thither with his Army. It was also called <i>Pera</i>, that is,
the <i>Ferry</i>, or <i>Per&aelig;a</i>, and stood on the other Side of the Water; as
<i>Josephus</i> relates, that <i>Jud&aelig;a</i> was on the other Side of <i>Jordan</i>;
and as <i>Strabo</i> mentions a Place, which he says was on the other Side
of <i>Euphrates</i>. <i>Anastasius</i> in his <i>Constitutions</i> calls it <i>Syc&aelig;</i>,
or the <i>Ferry</i> of <i>Syc&aelig;</i>, where he commands the Dead to be bury’d
without Fee, or Reward. ’Tis divided by a Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A50" id="Page_Page_A50">50</a></span> that runs from North to
South, and is bounded on each Side by two Vales, of a Mile in Length.
Its Walls are four Thousand four Hundred Paces in Compass. Near to
it, <i>Justinian</i> in his 159ᵗʰ <i>Nov.</i> seems to fix the Suburbs called
<i>Coparium</i>: And <i>Socrates</i> in his 30ᵗʰ <i>Chap.</i> of his <i>Eccles. Hist.</i>
tells us, that there’s a Place just against the City, which is called
<i>Syc&aelig;</i>. The Church of the <i>Novatians</i> was translated hither in the
Reign of <i>Constantine</i>.</p>

<p><i>It maintained an Intercourse with</i> Constantinople, <i>by Boats and
small Vessels</i>.] There were in the Bay here many Thousands of small
Boats, far exceeding the Number of those which are at <i>Venice</i> to carry
Passengers from one Shore to the other, so that this <i>Peninsula</i> might
reasonably be looked upon as a Part of the City. ’Tis almost surrounded
with Mountains, at the Foot of which, towards the Sea, it lies all upon
a Level to the opposite Shore. It contained a Church, the <i>Forum</i>,
and Theatre of <i>Honorius</i>, and many other Ornaments and Curiosities
in common with other <i>Wards</i>. There stood here a magnificent Church
dedicated to St. <i>Irene</i>, which was built by <i>Pertinax</i>, who had pass’d
the Consular Dignity, and was then <i>Patriarch</i> of <i>Constantinople</i>:
And <i>Constantine</i>, when he had beautified the <i>Ward</i> with many stately
Buildings, enclosed it with a Wall, as ’tis recorded by <i>Cardinal
Baronius</i> in his <i>Annals</i> of the Year 314.</p>

<p><i>The Dock.</i>] There was also a Place in this <i>Ward</i> where they built
their Ships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A51" id="Page_Page_A51">51</a></span></p>

<p>The Author has taken no Notice of two Streets which belonged to this
<i>Ward</i>, and which would complete the Number of three hundred and twenty
two Streets, mentioned in the Conclusion of his <i>Treatise</i>; but without
the Addition of them, we can reckon them three hundred and twenty and
no more.</p>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>Although this</i> Ward <i>is look’d upon to be a fourteenth Part of

Gate is somewhat upon the Level; but the right Side of it, rising into

<h4>NOTES.</h4>

<p><i>The fourteenth</i> Ward, <i>which is enclosed within its own Walls, makes
the Figure of a kind of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A52" id="Page_Page_A52">52</a></span> City by it self</i>.] It was antiently
looked upon to be a small City, because one of the Emperors had built
there an Imperial Citadel. ’Tis very mountainous about it, and it
descends towards the Sea, into the Bosom of a Plain. The Name of the
Church in this <i>Ward</i> is not known at present.</p>

<p><i>A Palace.</i>] This is the Place of Imperial Residence, which was
antiently called <i>Palatium</i>, because <i>Augustus</i> dwelt in Mount
<i>Palatine</i> at <i>Rome</i>. The Dwelling-House of <i>Romulus</i> was also called
by the same Name. Wherefore, says <i>Dion</i>, speaking of <i>Augustus</i>, let
the Emperor be where he pleases, yet the Place where he constantly
dwells, is always called his Palace.</p>

<p><i>A</i> Lusorium.] This probably was the same Place with the <i>Ludus
Venatorius</i>, in which the Combatants exercised themselves before
they engaged with wild Beasts; yet is it more probable, that it was
so called from the <i>Naves Lusori&aelig;</i>, which were built there, of which
<i>Marcellinus</i> takes Notice in his <i>sixth Book</i>, as also the <i>Code</i> of
<i>Theodosius de Lusoriis Danubii</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Wooden Bridge.</i>] <i>Suidas</i> writes, that near the Church of St.
<i>Mamas</i>, there was a Bridge which consisted of twelve Arches, for there
was a great Flood of Waters there. I believe this was after chang’d
into a Stone Bridge.</p>

<p><i>Five</i> Gradus, <i>or Stairs</i>.] At the End of this <i>Ward</i>, after the five
<i>Gradus</i>, I would correct the Omission of my Author, by comparing this
with the other <i>Wards</i>, and adding one <i>Curator</i>, one <i>Vernaculus</i>,
thirty seven <i>Collegiati</i>, and five <i>Vico-Magistri</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A53" id="Page_Page_A53">53</a></span></p>

<p>The Author, in his following summary View of the City, mentions five
hundred and sixty <i>Collegiati</i>, but to complete the Number of them,
there are wanting seven. <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i> has added three in
<i>Lib. de Commer. &amp; Mercat.</i> and makes the Number of them to be five
hundred and sixty three.</p>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>Having taken a particular View of the City, as divided into</i> Wards,
<i>I shall now</i>, continues my Author, <i>give the Reader a more large and
general Description of it, to shew that its Beauty and Magnificence is
not only to be ascribed to Art and good Workmanship, but that Nature
herself by the Mediation of the Elements, has happily contributed
to its Security and Defence. The divine Providence has with so much
Wisdom consulted the Preservation of its Inhabitants, even to future
Ages, that a long Tract of Land, in the Nature of a</i> Promontory,
<i>full of Windings and Harbours in its Sides, facing the Chaps of the</i>
Black-Sea, <i>narrow in Breadth, is strongly fortified by the Sea. The</i>
Isthmus, <i>the only Part of the City not bounded by the Sea, is at the

<p><i>It has five Palaces.</i>] Old <i>Rome</i>, instead of these, has one Thousand
one hundred and eighty Houses.</p>

<p><i>Fourteen Churches.</i>] <i>Rome</i> had four Hundred and twenty four Temples.</p>

<p><i>Five divine Houses of the</i> August&aelig;, <i>and of those who bore the Title
of the Most Illustrious three</i>.] The Houses of those Ladies, who bore
the Title<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A55" id="Page_Page_A55">55</a></span> of <i>August&aelig;</i> were called Divine. They had also other Marks
of Imperiality and Honour conferr’d upon them. By the Mistake of the
Writer these Houses were reckoned six, though they were no more in
Number than five only, <i>viz.</i> two of <i>Placidia</i>, two of <i>Pulcheria</i>,
and one of <i>Eudocia</i>, the Wife of <i>Theodosius</i>. As to the Houses
belonging to the Ladies, entitled the <i>Most Illustrious</i>, one of them
belonged to <i>Marina</i>, and the other two to <i>Arcadia</i>, and bore the same
Title with themselves.</p>

<p><i>Eight</i> Bagnio’s.] <i>Victor</i> writes, that at <i>Rome</i> there were eleven.</p>

<p><i>Two Senate-Houses.</i>] At <i>Rome</i>, as <i>Victor</i> says, there were three;
one stood between the <i>Capitol</i>, and the <i>Forum Romanum</i>, where was the
Temple of <i>Concord</i>; another by the <i>Porta Capena</i>, and a third in the
Temple of <i>Bellona</i>, which stood in the <i>Circo</i> of <i>Flaminius</i>, where
the Foreign Ambassadors resided, because they would not allow them
Admittance into the City.</p>

<p><i>Five Granaries.</i>] At <i>Rome</i> there were two hundred and ninety two.</p>

<p><i>Two Theatres.</i>] At <i>Rome</i> there were three.</p>

twenty four.</p>

<p><i>Four Thousand three hundred and eighteen large Houses.</i>] At <i>Rome</i>
there were forty six Thousand six hundred and two <i>Insul&aelig;</i>, and one
Thousand seven hundred and eighty large Houses. The Houses here
mentioned were large roof’d Buildings, tyl’d at Top four Ways; the
<i>Insul&aelig;</i> were roof’d Buildings, tyl’d only before and behind.</p>

<p><i>A hundred and seventeen</i> Gradus.] At <i>Rome</i> none.</p>

<p><i>Five Flesh-Markets.</i>] At <i>Rome</i> two only.</p>

<p><i>Five hundred and sixty</i> Collegiati.] It is apparent that thirty seven
of them are omitted in the last <i>Ward</i>. There was no such Office at
<i>Rome</i>, yet there were, instead of them, Watchmen divided into seven
Companies, whose Business, according to <i>Dion</i> and <i>Suetonius</i>, was
much the same with that of the <i>Collegiati</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sixty five</i> Vico-magistri.] It should be read seventy; for five
of them are omitted in the last <i>Ward</i>. At <i>Rome</i> the Number of

<p><i>A Porphyry Pillar.</i>] There was no such Pillar, as <i>Cedrinus</i> says,
at <i>Rome</i>, tho’ this was brought from thence. <i>Gyllius</i> writes, that
this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A57" id="Page_Page_A57">57</a></span> Pillar was made of square marble Stones, and that it stood in the
<i>Hippodrom</i>.</p>

<p><i>Two Pillars with Winding-Stairs in the Inside of them.</i>] There was the
same Number at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><i>One</i> Colossus.] At <i>Rome</i> there were two. ’Tis omitted in the
<i>Description of the Wards</i>, as many other Things of Note are.</p>

<p><i>The Golden</i> Tetrapylum.] <i>Gyllius</i> quotes an unknown Author who will
have this <i>Tetrapylum</i> to have been a Quadrangle with <i>Portico’s</i>
round it, having Four Gates, and was formerly call’d <i>Quadrivium</i>. The
<i>Latines</i> call it a <i>Stadium</i>. But there’s no such Place to be found
in the <i>Wards</i> of the City, unless it be the <i>Stadium</i> in the Fourth
<i>Ward</i>, which is omitted in the <i>Summary View</i> of the City. <i>Cedrinus</i>,
in his Life of <i>Leo Magnus</i>, mentions this <i>Tetrapylum</i>. <i>Evagrius</i>
in the <i>twenty eighth Chapter</i> of his <i>third Book</i> tells us, that
it was built by the Senator <i>Mammianus</i>, in the Reign of <i>Zeno</i>. He
built, says he, two stately <i>Portico’s</i> of exquisite Workmanship, and
beautify’d them with a neat glossy Marble. As to the <i>Tetrapylum</i> built
by <i>Mammianus</i>, there are not, as <i>Gyllius</i> tells us, the least Remains
of it. <i>Victor</i> writes, that there was a <i>Pentapylum</i> in the tenth
<i>Ward</i> of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Augusteum.] This was the <i>Forum</i> of <i>Augustus</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Capitol.</i>] At <i>Rome</i>, as <i>Victor</i> writes, there were two; the old
and the new <i>Capitol</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Mint, or Treasury.</i>] There was no such Place at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A58" id="Page_Page_A58">58</a></span></p>

<p><i>Three</i> Gradus <i>by the Sea-Shore</i>.] There were no such <i>Stairs</i> at
<i>Rome</i>, yet they had their <i>Lakes</i>, their <i>Naval Fights</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The City is reported to have had twenty three Gates. <i>Laonicus
Chalcondylus</i>, in his History of the <i>Ottomans</i>, tells us, that
<i>Constantinople</i> contains in compass a hundred and eleven Furlongs,
which is more than thirteen <i>Italian</i> Miles. ’Tis generally thought
to be eighteen Miles in Circumference. Besides the foremention’d
Curiosities, <i>Constantinople</i> has been famous for the <i>Aqueduct</i>
of <i>Hadrian</i>, which furnish’d the Palace, the <i>Nymphea</i>, and the
<i>Bagnio’s</i> with a Sufficiency of Waters, as <i>Theodosius</i> mentions in a
Letter to <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Prefect</i> of the City. The <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Achilles</i>
are also mention’d by him, where he says, that these <i>Bagnio’s</i> were
supply’d with Water convey’d into them from the said <i>Aqueduct</i> by
leaden Pipes. <i>Cedrinus</i> says, that these <i>Bagnio’s</i> were built
near the <i>Strategium</i>, and took their Name from an Altar, which was
dedicated to <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Achilles:</i> And <i>Cassiodorus</i> relates, that the
Fire, which happen’d in the Reign of <i>Constantine</i> the <i>Great</i>, burnt
down the City, as far as the <i>Bagnio’s</i> of <i>Achilles</i>.</p>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>Procopius</i> tells us, in his first Book <i>de &AElig;dif. Justin.</i> that
the <i>Hepdomum</i> was one Part of the Suburbs of <i>Constantinople</i>.
<i>Justinian</i>, says he, built another Church dedicate to St. <i>Theodora</i>
in a Place call’d the <i>Hepdomum</i>, which in the <i>Greek</i> signifies the
<i>Seventh</i>. <i>Zonaras</i>, in the Life of <i>Phocas</i>, mentions the same
Thing, as does also <i>Cedrinus</i> in the Life of <i>Arcadius</i> and <i>Justin</i>,
with many others. In this Place were many Laws enacted; and <i>Zonaras</i>
writes, that <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Great</i> built a Church there, in Honour
of St. <i>John Baptist</i>. <i>Gyllius</i> says, that ’tis at present enclos’d
within the Walls of the City, that it stands upon the sixth Hill, and
that ’tis call’d <i>Hepdomum</i>, or <i>Seventh</i>, as denoting the Number of
the Suburbs of the City.</p>

<p><i>The</i> Blachern&aelig;.] This is another Part of the Suburbs, mention’d
by <i>Justinian</i> in his 151ˢᵗ <i>Nov.</i> where he says, that <i>Hierius</i>
bequeath’d by Will to his Son <i>Anthemius</i> the Suburbs in the
<i>Blachern&aelig;</i>. <i>Zonaras</i> writes, that <i>Pulcheria</i>, the Sister of
<i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>, built a Church to the <i>Blessed Virgin</i> in this
Place, which, as <i>Procopius</i> tells us, was repair’d by <i>Justinian</i>.
<i>Cedrinus</i> observes, that the Emperor <i>Justin</i>, Nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A60" id="Page_Page_A60">60</a></span> of <i>Justinian</i>,
enlarg’d it with two Arches. <i>Suidas</i> reports, that <i>Anastasius</i> the
Emperor built there a large <i>Triclinium</i> and <i>Tiberius</i> a <i>Bagnio</i>, as
<i>Zonaras</i> writes. It took its Name of the <i>Blachern&aelig;</i>, as <i>Gyllius</i>
believes, upon the Authority of <i>Dionysius</i> a <i>Byzantian</i> Writer, from
some Person, who was formerly a kind of a petty King there. It was
situate near the Sea, in the Place, as <i>Nicephorus</i> observes in his
15ᵗʰ <i>Book</i> <i>Chap.</i> 25ᵗʰ <i>of his Eccl. Hist.</i> where <i>Leo</i> the <i>Great</i>
built a Church to the Virgin <i>Mary</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Monastery</i> of <i>Studius</i> was another Part of the Suburbs of
<i>Constantinople</i>, in which, as <i>Justinian</i> observes, in his 6ᵗʰ <i>Chap.</i>
<i>Novel</i> 59ᵗʰ. was kept a large Bier, for the Burial of the Dead. The
following Account is given of <i>Studius</i> by <i>Nicephorus</i>, in his 15ᵗʰ
<i>Book</i>, <i>Chap.</i> 25ᵗʰ <i>of his Eccles. Hist.</i> An eminent Citizen of
<i>Rome</i>, says he, nam’d <i>Studius</i>, came from thence to <i>Constantinople</i>,
where he built a Church to the Memory of St. <i>John Baptist</i>, and
that divine Service might be celebrated there with more Decency and
Solemnity, he took some Monks out of the Monastery of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀκοίμητοι</span>, who were so call’d, because some of them were always
<i>waking</i> to attend divine Worship. The heavenly-minded <i>Marcellinus</i>
built them a Monastery, in which they continually sang Hymns to God,
their Society being divided into three Tribes for that Purpose. Thus
far <i>Nicephorus</i>. Upon this Occasion <i>Studius</i> was made <i>Consul</i>, as
appears by an Inscription over the Gate of his own Monastery, which
runs thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A61" id="Page_Page_A61">61</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line"><i>In just Acknowledgment, the grateful Town</i>,</div>
<div class="line"><i>Repay’d the Founder with a</i> Consul’s <i>Gown</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">This happen’d in the Reign of <i>Leo</i> the Emperor.</p>

<p>The <i>Coparia</i>, as is plain from the 159ᵗʰ <i>Nov. of Justinian</i>, was
another Part of the Suburbs, and was bequeath’d, as appears by the
Codicil of <i>Hierius</i>’s Will to his Niece.</p>

<p>There was also another Part of the Suburbs in the <i>Promontory</i> of
the Creek of <i>Sosthenium</i>, which was formerly in the Possession of
<i>Ardaburus</i>, General of the Army to <i>Theodosius</i> the <i>Less</i>. The Right
of it afterwards came to <i>Hierius</i>, who was <i>Pr&aelig;fectus Pr&aelig;torio</i>, or
General of the Life-Guard to the Emperor <i>Zeno</i>. <i>Nicephorus</i> in the
50ᵗʰ <i>Chap. of his</i> 7ᵗʰ <i>Book of Eccl. Hist.</i> gives this Reason why it
was call’d <i>Sosthenium</i>, ’Tis recorded, says he, that the <i>Argonauts</i>
of <i>Greece</i>, when they arriv’d here, began to plunder the Countrey,
but were defeated by <i>Amycus</i>, who was then Governor of the Place,
and being dispers’d, they wander’d about till they came to a woody
unhospitable Place, where they took shelter in a large Thicket of
Trees; that in this Calamity <i>Virtue</i> came down to them from Heaven in
a human Shape, having Wings like an Eagle, and by her Oracle foretold,
that if they would venture another Battle, they should conquer
<i>Amycus</i>. Directed by this Advice, they engag’d them again, obtain’d
an entire Victory over them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A62" id="Page_Page_A62">62</a></span> slew him, and all his Forces; and that
to express their Gratitude to the <i>Vision</i>, they built a Temple, and
erected a Statue to her, in the Shape she appear’d to them, which gave
the Place the Name of <i>Sosthenium</i>, because they <i>secur’d</i> themselves
by the second Battle.</p>

<p>Bytharium, <i>or</i> Philotheum.] This was also another Part of the
<i>Suburbs</i>, and is mention’d as such in 159ᵗʰ <i>Nov. of Justinian</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Porta Veneta</i> is mentioned by <i>Procopius</i> in his <i>History of the</i>
Persian <i>War</i>; who, speaking of some military Officer, tells us, that
when he came to the <i>Porta Veneta</i>, which stands on the Right Hand of
the Palace, he halted and determin’d to march to <i>Hypalium</i>. This Gate
seems to take its Name from the <i>Suburbs</i> call’d <i>in Venetis</i>, probably
because the <i>Venetian Faction</i>, a Company of Chariot-Racers dress’d in
<i>Sky-colour’d</i> Cloths, dwelt there.</p>

<p><i>Procopius</i> also takes Notice of the <i>Pontichium</i> by the Ferry, and
also of the <i>Rusiniana</i>, as two other Parts of the <i>Suburbs</i>. These
Places he mentions in his 1ˢᵗ <i>Book of the</i> Persian <i>War</i>; as does also
<i>Sozomen</i> in the 21ˢᵗ <i>Chap.</i> <i>Book</i> the 8ᵗʰ.</p>

<p class="dropcap2"><i>Gyllius</i> assures us, that the whole City, at present, is under a
visible Decay, as to its Buildings; that the Houses are low and mean,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_Page_A63" id="Page_Page_A63">63</a></span>
and that there’s little or nothing to be seen of its ancient Beauty
and Magnificence, except in a few of their <i>Basha’s</i> Houses, their
<i>Mosques</i>, their <i>Bagnio’s</i>, and their <i>Caravansera’s</i>, which are all
very noble Buildings, and are as follows.</p>

<p>There are at least three hundred <i>Mosques</i> built with Marble, cover’d
with Lead, and shining with glossy marble Pillars.</p>

<p>There are above a hundred publick <i>Bagnio’s</i>, both for Men and Women,
which are very spacious.</p>

<p>There are also about the same Number of <i>Caravansera’s</i>; the most

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
